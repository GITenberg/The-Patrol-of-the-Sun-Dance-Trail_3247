    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRAIL-RUNNER
    </h3>
    <p>
      High up on the hillside in the midst of a rugged group of jack pines the
      Union Jack shook out its folds gallantly in the breeze that swept down the
      Kicking Horse Pass. That gallant flag marked the headquarters of
      Superintendent Strong, of the North West Mounted Police, whose special
      duty it was to preserve law and order along the construction line of the
      Canadian Pacific Railway Company, now pushed west some scores of miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the tote-road, which ran parallel to the steel, a man, dark of skin,
      slight but wiry, came running, his hard panting, his streaming face, his
      open mouth proclaiming his exhaustion. At a little trail that led to the
      left he paused, noted its course toward the flaunting flag, turned into
      it, then struggled up the rocky hillside till he came to the wooden shack,
      with a deep porch running round it, and surrounded by a rustic fence which
      enclosed a garden whose neatness illustrated a characteristic of the
      British soldier. The runner passed in through the gate and up the little
      gravel walk and began to ascend the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; A quick sharp voice arrested him. &ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; From
      the side of the shack an orderly appeared, neat, trim and dandified in
      appearance, from his polished boots to his wide cowboy hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beeg Chief,&rdquo; panted the runner. &ldquo;Me&mdash;see&mdash;beeg Chief&mdash;queeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The orderly looked him over and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want Big Chief for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me&mdash;want&mdash;say somet'ing,&rdquo; said the little man, fighting to
      recover his breath, &ldquo;somet'ing beeg&mdash;sure beeg.&rdquo; He made a step
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt there!&rdquo; said the orderly sharply. &ldquo;Keep out, you half-breed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See&mdash;beeg Chief&mdash;queeck,&rdquo; panted the half-breed, for so he was,
      with fierce insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orderly hesitated. A year ago he would have hustled him off the porch
      in short order. But these days were anxious days. Rumors wild and
      terrifying were running through the trails of the dark forest. Everywhere
      were suspicion and unrest. The Indian tribes throughout the western
      territories and in the eastern part of British Columbia, under cover of an
      unwonted quiet, were in a state of excitement, and this none knew better
      than the North West Mounted Police. With stoical unconcern the Police
      patroled their beats, rode in upon the reserves, careless, cheery, but
      with eyes vigilant for signs and with ears alert for sounds of the coming
      storm. Only the Mounted Police, however, and a few old-timers who knew the
      Indians and their half-breed kindred gave a single moment's thought to the
      bare possibility of danger. The vast majority of the Canadian people knew
      nothing of the tempestuous gatherings of French half-breed settlers in
      little hamlets upon the northern plains along the Saskatchewan. The fiery
      resolutions reported now and then in the newspapers reciting the wrongs
      and proclaiming the rights of these remote, ignorant, insignificant,
      half-tamed pioneers of civilization roused but faint interest in the minds
      of the people of Canada. Formal resolutions and petitions of rights had
      been regularly sent during the past two years to Ottawa and there as
      regularly pigeon-holed above the desks of deputy ministers. The
      politicians had a somewhat dim notion that there was some sort of row on
      among the &ldquo;breeds&rdquo; about Prince Albert and Battleford, but this concerned
      them little. The members of the Opposition found in the resolutions and
      petitions of rights useful ammunition for attack upon the Government. In
      purple periods the leader arraigned the supineness and the indifference of
      the Premier and his Government to &ldquo;the rights and wrongs of our
      fellow-citizens who, amid the hardships of a pioneer civilization, were
      laying broad and deep the foundations of Empire.&rdquo; But after the smoke and
      noise of the explosion had passed both Opposition and Government speedily
      forgot the half-breed and his tempestuous gatherings in the stores and
      schoolhouses, at church doors and in open camps, along the banks of the
      far away Saskatchewan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few men, however, that could not forget. An Indian agent here
      and there with a sense of responsibility beyond the pickings of his post,
      a Hudson Bay factor whose long experience in handling the affairs of
      half-breeds and Indians instructed him to read as from a printed page what
      to others were meaningless and incoherent happenings, and above all the
      officers of the Mounted Police, whose duty it was to preserve the &ldquo;pax
      Britannica&rdquo; over some three hundred thousand square miles of Her Majesty's
      dominions in this far northwest reach of Empire, these carried night and
      day an uneasiness in their minds which found vent from time to time in
      reports and telegraphic messages to members of Government and other
      officials at headquarters, who slept on, however, undisturbed. But the
      word was passed along the line of Police posts over the plains and far out
      into British Columbia to watch for signs and to be on guard. The Police
      paid little heed to the high-sounding resolutions of a few angry excitable
      half-breeds, who, daring though they were and thoroughly able to give a
      good account of themselves in any trouble that might arise, were quite
      insignificant in number; but there was another peril, so serious, so
      terrible, that the oldest officer on the force spoke of it with face
      growing grave and with lowered voice&mdash;the peril of an Indian
      uprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this and more made the trim orderly hesitate. A runner with news was
      not to be kicked unceremoniously off the porch in these days, but to be
      considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see the Superintendent, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui, for sure&mdash;queeck&mdash;run ten mile,&rdquo; replied the half-breed
      with angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the orderly, &ldquo;what's your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name? Me, Pinault&mdash;Pierre Pinault. Ah, sacr-r-e! Beeg Chief know me&mdash;Pinault.&rdquo;
       The little man drew himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Wait!&rdquo; replied the orderly, and passed into the shack. He had
      hardly disappeared when he was back again, obviously shaken out of his
      correct military form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in!&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Get a move on! What are you waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed threw him a sidelong glance of contempt and passed quickly
      into the &ldquo;Beeg Chief's&rdquo; presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superintendent Strong was a man prompt in decision and prompt in action, a
      man of courage, too, unquestioned, and with that bulldog spirit that sees
      things through to a finish. To these qualities it was that he owed his
      present command, for it was no insignificant business to keep the peace
      and to make the law run along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway
      through the Kicking Horse Pass during construction days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed had been but a few minutes with the Chief when the orderly
      was again startled out of his military decorum by the bursting open of the
      Superintendent's door and the sharp rattle of the Superintendent's orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Sergeant Ferry to me at once and have my horse and his brought round
      immediately!&rdquo; The orderly sprang to attention and saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; he replied, and swiftly departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes' conference with Sergeant Ferry, a few brief commands to the
      orderly, and the Superintendent and Sergeant were on their way down the
      steep hillside toward the tote-road that led eastward through the pass. A
      half-hour's ride brought them to a trail that led off to the south, into
      which the Superintendent, followed by the Sergeant, turned his horse. Not
      a word was spoken by either man. It was not the Superintendent's custom to
      share his plans with his subordinate officers until it became necessary.
      &ldquo;What you keep behind your teeth,&rdquo; was a favorite maxim with the
      Superintendent, &ldquo;will harm neither yourself nor any other man.&rdquo; They were
      on the old Kootenay Trail, for a hundred years and more the ancient
      pathway of barter and of war for the Indian tribes that hunted the western
      plains and the foothill country and brought their pelts to the coast by
      way of the Columbia River. Along the lower levels the old trail ran,
      avoiding, with the sure instinct of a skilled engineer, nature's
      obstacles, and taking full advantage of every sloping hillside and every
      open stretch of woods. Now and then, however, the trail must needs burrow
      through a deep thicket of spruce and jack pine and scramble up a rocky
      ridge, where the horses, trained as they were in mountain climbing, had
      all they could do to keep their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten miles and more they followed the tortuous trail, skirting mountain
      peaks and burrowing through underbrush, scrambling up rocky ridges and
      sliding down their farther sides, till they came to a park-like country
      where from the grassy sward the big Douglas firs, trimmed clear of lower
      growth and standing spaced apart, lifted on red and glistening trunks
      their lofty crowns of tufted evergreen far above the lesser trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the open country the Superintendent proceeded with
      greater caution, pausing now and then to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ought to be a big powwow going on somewhere near,&rdquo; he said to his
      Sergeant, &ldquo;but I can hear nothing. Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant leaned over his horse's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not a sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it can't be far away,&rdquo; growled the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail led through the big firs and dipped into a little grassy valley
      set round with thickets on every side. Into this open glade they rode. The
      Superintendent was plainly disturbed and irritated; irritated because
      surprised and puzzled. Where he had expected to find a big Indian powwow
      he found only a quiet sunny glade in the midst of a silent forest.
      Sergeant Ferry waited behind him in respectful silence, too wise to offer
      any observation upon the situation. Hence in the Superintendent grew a
      deeper irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be&mdash;!&rdquo; He paused abruptly. The Superintendent rarely used
      profanity. He reserved this form of emphasis for supreme moments. He was
      possessed of a dramatic temperament and appreciated at its full value the
      effect of a climax. The climax had not yet arrived, hence his
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, determined to be agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't seem to be here, sir,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, staring up into
      the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; cried the Superintendent, following the direction of the
      Sergeant's eyes. &ldquo;Do you suppose they're a lot of confounded monkeys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly&mdash;that is&mdash;no, sir, not at all, sir. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were to have been here,&rdquo; said the Superintendent angrily. &ldquo;My
      information was most positive and trustworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so, sir,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant. &ldquo;But they haven't been here at
      all!&rdquo; The Superintendent impatiently glared at the Sergeant, as if he were
      somehow responsible for this inexplicable failure upon the part of the
      Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly&mdash;that is&mdash;no, sir. No sign. Not a sign.&rdquo; The Sergeant
      was most emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, where in&mdash;where&mdash;?&rdquo; The Superintendent felt himself
      rapidly approaching an emotional climax and took himself back with a jerk.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, with obvious self-control, &ldquo;let's look about a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With keen and practised eyes they searched the glade, and the forest round
      about it, and the trails leading to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sign,&rdquo; said the Superintendent emphatically, &ldquo;and for the first
      time in my experience Pinault is wrong&mdash;the very first time. He was
      dead sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinault&mdash;generally right, sir,&rdquo; observed the Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. But this time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been fooled,&rdquo; declared the Superintendent. &ldquo;A big sun dance was
      planned for this identical spot. They were all to be here, every tribe
      represented, the Stonies even had been drawn into it, some of the young
      bloods I suppose. And, more than that, the Sioux from across the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sioux, eh?&rdquo; said the Sergeant. &ldquo;I didn't know the Sioux were in
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, perhaps not, but I have information that the Sioux&mdash;in fact&mdash;&rdquo;
       here the Superintendent dropped his voice and unconsciously glanced about
      him, &ldquo;the Sioux are very much in this, and old Copperhead himself is the
      moving spirit of the whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperhead!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sergeant in an equally subdued tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, that old devil is taking a hand in the game. My information was
      that he was to have been here to-day, and, by the Lord Harry! if he had
      been we would have put him where the dogs wouldn't bite him. The thing is
      growing serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sergeant in unwonted excitement. &ldquo;You just bet&mdash;that
      is exactly so, sir. Why the Sioux must be good for a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand!&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent. &ldquo;I've the most positive
      information that the Sioux could place in the war path two thousand
      fighting-men inside of a month. And old Copperhead is at the bottom of it
      all. We want that old snake, and we want him badly.&rdquo; And the
      Superintendent swung on to his horse and set off on the return trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, we generally get what we want in that way,&rdquo; volunteered the
      Sergeant, following his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do&mdash;in the long run. But in this same old Copperhead we have the
      acutest Indian brain in all the western country. Sitting Bull was a
      fighter, Copperhead is a schemer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rode in silence, the Sergeant busy with a dozen schemes whereby he
      might lay old Copperhead by the heels; the Superintendent planning
      likewise. But in the Superintendent's plans the Sergeant had no place. The
      capture of the great Sioux schemer must be entrusted to a cooler head than
      that of the impulsive, daring, loyal-hearted Sergeant.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      HIS COUNTRY'S NEED
    </h3>
    <p>
      For full five miles they rode in unbroken silence, the Superintendent
      going before with head pressed down on his breast and eyes fixed upon the
      winding trail. A heavy load lay upon him. True, his immediate sphere of
      duty lay along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, but as an officer
      of Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police he shared with the other
      officers of that force the full responsibility of holding in steadfast
      loyalty the tribes of Western Indians. His knowledge of the presence in
      the country of the arch-plotter of the powerful and warlike Sioux from
      across the line entailed a new burden. Well he knew that his superior
      officer would simply expect him to deal with the situation in a
      satisfactory manner. But how, was the puzzle. A mere handful of men he had
      under his immediate command and these dispersed in ones and twos along the
      line of railway, and not one of them fit to cope with the cunning and
      daring Sioux.
    </p>
    <p>
      With startling abruptness he gave utterance to his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get him&mdash;and quick. Things are moving too rapidly for any
      delay. The truth is,&rdquo; he continued, with a deepening impatience in his
      voice, &ldquo;the truth is we are short-handed. We ought to be able to patrol
      every trail in this country. That old villain has fooled us to-day and
      he'll fool us again. And he has fooled Pinault, the smartest breed we've
      got. He's far too clever to be around loose among our Indians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they rode along in silence, the Superintendent thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where he is!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, pulling up his horse. &ldquo;I know
      where he is&mdash;this blessed minute. He's on the Sun Dance Trail and in
      the Sun Dance Canyon, and they're having the biggest kind of a powwow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sun Dance!&rdquo; echoed the Sergeant. &ldquo;By Jove, if only Sergeant Cameron
      were on this job! He knows the Sun Dance inside and out, every foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent swung his horse sharply round to face his Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cameron!&rdquo; he exclaimed thoughtfully. &ldquo;Cameron! I believe you're right.
      He's the man&mdash;the very man. But,&rdquo; he added with sudden remembrance,
      &ldquo;he's left the Force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left the Force, sir. Yes, sir,&rdquo; echoed the Sergeant with a grin. &ldquo;He
      appeared to have a fairly good reason, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reason!&rdquo; snorted the Superintendent. &ldquo;Reason! What in&mdash;? What did he&mdash;?
      Why did he pull off that fool stunt at this particular time? A kid like
      him has no business getting married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty fine girl, sir,&rdquo; suggested the Sergeant warmly. &ldquo;Mighty lucky
      chap. Not many fellows could resist such a sharp attack as he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine girl! Oh, of course, of course&mdash;fine girl certainly. Fine girl.
      But what's that got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; ventured the Sergeant in a tone of surprise, &ldquo;a good deal,
      sir, I should say. By Jove, sir, I could have&mdash;if I could have pulled
      it off myself&mdash;but of course she was an old flame of Cameron's and
      I'd no chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Service, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent with growing
      indignation. &ldquo;The Service! Why! Cameron was right in line for promotion.
      He had the making of a most useful officer. And with this trouble coming
      on it was&mdash;it was&mdash;a highly foolish, indeed a highly
      reprehensible proceeding, sir.&rdquo; The Superintendent was rapidly mounting
      his pet hobby, which was the Force in which he had the honor to be an
      officer, the far-famed North West Mounted Police. For the Service he had
      sacrificed everything in life, ease, wealth, home, yes, even wife and
      family, to a certain extent. With him the Force was a passion. For it he
      lived and breathed. That anyone should desert it for any cause soever was
      to him an act unexplainable. He almost reckoned it treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the question was one that touched the Sergeant as well, and deeply.
      Hence, though he well knew his Chief's dominant passion, he ventured an
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mighty fine girl, sir, something very special. She saw me through a
      mountain fever once, and I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the deuce take it, Sergeant! The girl is all right. I grant you all
      that. But is that any reason why a man should desert the Force? And now of
      all times? He's only a kid. So is she. She can't be twenty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five? Good Lord, no!&rdquo; exclaimed the shocked Sergeant. &ldquo;She isn't a
      day over twenty. Why, look at her. She's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tut-tut! If she's twenty it makes it all the worse. Why couldn't they
      wait till this fuss was over? Why, sir, when I was twenty&mdash;&rdquo; The
      Superintendent paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; The Sergeant's manner was respectful and expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;Why rush the thing, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I did hear that there was a sudden change in Cameron's home
      affairs in Scotland, sir. His father died suddenly, I believe. The estate
      was sold up and his sister, the only other child, was left all alone.
      Cameron felt it necessary to get a home together&mdash;though I don't
      suppose he needed any excuse. Never saw a man so hard hit myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except yourself, Sergeant, eh?&rdquo; said the Superintendent, relaxing into a
      grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, of course, sir, I'm not going to deny it. But you see,&rdquo;
       continued the Sergeant, his pride being touched, &ldquo;he had known her down
      East&mdash;worked on her father's farm&mdash;young gentleman&mdash;fresh
      from college&mdash;culture, you know, manner&mdash;style and that sort of
      thing&mdash;rushed her clean off her feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said it was Cameron who was the one hard hit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was, sir. Hadn't seen her for a couple of years or so. Left her a
      country lass, uncouth, ignorant&mdash;at least so they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, her friends&mdash;Dr. Martin and the nurse at the hospital. But I
      can't believe them, simply impossible. That this girl two years ago should
      have been an ignorant, clumsy, uncouth country lass is impossible.
      However, Cameron came on her here, transfigured, glorified so to speak,
      consequently fell over neck in love, went quite batty in fact. A secret
      flame apparently smoldering all these months suddenly burst into a blaze&mdash;a
      blaze, by Jove!&mdash;regular conflagration. And no wonder, sir, when you
      look at her, her face, her form, her style&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Sergeant, we'll move on. Let's keep at the business in hand.
      The question is what's to do. That old snake Copperhead is three hundred
      miles from here on the Sun Dance, plotting hell for this country, and we
      want him. As you say, Cameron's our man. I wonder,&rdquo; continued the
      Superintendent after a pause, &ldquo;I wonder if we could get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say certainly not!&rdquo; replied the Sergeant promptly. &ldquo;He's only a
      few months married, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might,&rdquo; mused the Superintendent, &ldquo;if it were properly put to him. It
      would be a great thing for the Service. He's the man. By the Lord Harry,
      he's the only man! In short,&rdquo; with a resounding whack upon his thigh, &ldquo;he
      has got to come. The situation is too serious for trifling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trifling?&rdquo; said the Sergeant to himself in undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go for him. We'll send for him.&rdquo; The Superintendent turned and
      glanced at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me, sir, I hope. You can quite see, sir, I'd be a mighty poor
      advocate. Couldn't face those blue eyes, sir. They make me grow quite
      weak. Chills and fever&mdash;in short, temporary delirium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, Sergeant,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent, &ldquo;if it's as bad as that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know her, sir. Those eyes! They can burn in blue flame or melt
      in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, I've no doubt.&rdquo; The Superintendent's voice had a touch of
      pity, if not contempt. &ldquo;We won't expose you, Sergeant. But all the same
      we'll make a try for Cameron.&rdquo; His voice grew stern. His lips drew to a
      line. &ldquo;And we'll get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant's horse took a sudden plunge forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you beast!&rdquo; he cried, with a fierce oath. &ldquo;Come back here! What's
      the matter with you?&rdquo; He threw the animal back on his haunches with a
      savage jerk, a most unaccustomed thing with the Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; pursued the Superintendent, &ldquo;the situation demands it. Cameron's
      the man. It's his old stamping-ground. He knows every twist of its trails.
      And he's a wonder, a genius for handling just such a business as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant made no reply. He was apparently having some trouble with his
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued the Superintendent, with a glance at his Sergeant's
      face, &ldquo;it's hard on her, but&mdash;&rdquo; dismissing that feature of the case
      lightly&mdash;&ldquo;in a situation like this everything must give way. The
      latest news is exceedingly grave. The trouble along the Saskatchewan looks
      to me exceedingly serious. These half-breeds there have real grievances. I
      know them well, excitable, turbulent in their spirits, uncontrollable, but
      easily handled if decently treated. They've sent their petitions again and
      again to Ottawa, and here are these Members of Parliament making fool
      speeches, and the Government pooh-poohing the whole movement, and meantime
      Riel orating and organizing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riel? Who's he?&rdquo; inquired the Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riel? You don't know Riel? That's what comes of being an island-bred
      Britisher. You people know nothing outside your own little two by four
      patch on the world's map. Haven't you heard of Riel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, by the way, I've heard about the Johnny. Mixed up in something
      before in this country, wasn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather! The rebel leader of 1870. Cost us some considerable
      trouble, too. There's bound to be mischief where that hair-brained
      four-flusher gets a crowd to listen to him. For egoist though he is, he
      possesses a wonderful power over the half-breeds. He knows how to work.
      And somehow, too, they're suspicious of all Canadians, as they call the
      new settlers from the East, ready to believe anything they're told, and
      with plenty of courage to risk a row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the row about, anyway?&rdquo; inquired the Sergeant. &ldquo;I could never
      quite get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are many causes. These half-breeds are squatters, many of them.
      They have introduced the same system of survey on the Saskatchewan as
      their ancestors had on the St. Lawrence, and later on the Red, the system
      of 'Strip Farms.' That is, farms with narrow fronts upon the river and
      extending back from a mile to four miles, a poor arrangement for farming
      but mighty fine for social purposes. I tell you, it takes the loneliness
      and isolation out of pioneer life. I've lived among them, and the
      strip-farm survey possesses distinct social advantages. You have two rows
      of houses a few rods apart, and between them the river, affording an ice
      roadway in the winter and a waterway in the summer. And to see a flotilla
      of canoes full of young people, with fiddles and concertinas going, paddle
      down the river on their way to a neighbor's house for a dance, is
      something to remember. For my part I don't wonder that these people resent
      the action of the Government in introducing a completely new survey
      without saying 'by your leave.' There are troubles, too, about their land
      patents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many of these half-breeds are there anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, only a few hundreds I should say. But it isn't the half-breeds we
      fear. The mischief of it is they have been sending runners all through
      this country to their red-skin friends and relatives, holding out all
      sorts of promises, the restoration of their hunting grounds to the
      Indians, the establishing of an empire of the North, from which the white
      race shall be excluded. I've heard them. Just enough truth and sense in
      the whole mad scheme to appeal to the Indian mind. The older men, the
      chiefs, are quiet so far, but the young braves are getting out of hand.
      You see they have no longer their ancient excitement of war and the chase.
      Life has grown monotonous, to the young men especially, on the reserves.
      They are chafing under control, and the prospect of a fight appeals to
      them. In every tribe sun dances are being held, braves are being made, and
      from across the other side weapons are being introduced. And now that this
      old snake Copperhead has crossed the line the thing takes an ugly look.
      He's undeniably brainy, a fearless fighter, an extraordinary organizer,
      has great influence with his own people and is greatly respected among our
      tribes. If an Indian war should break out with Copperhead running it&mdash;well&mdash;!
      That's why it's important to get this old devil. And it must be done
      quietly. Any movement in force on our part would set the prairie on fire.
      The thing has got to be done by one or two men. That's why we must have
      Cameron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his indignation the Sergeant was impressed. Never had he heard
      his Chief discourse at such length, and never had he heard his Chief use
      the word &ldquo;danger.&rdquo; It began to dawn upon his mind that possibly it might
      not be such a crime as he had at first considered it to lure Cameron away
      from his newly made home and his newly wedded wife to do this bit of
      service for his country in an hour of serious if not desperate need.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A-FISHING WE WILL GO
    </h3>
    <p>
      But Sergeant Cameron was done with the Service for ever. An accumulating
      current of events had swept him from his place in the Force, as an
      unheeding traveler crossing a mountain torrent is swept from his feet by a
      raging freshet. The sudden blazing of his smoldering love into a consuming
      flame for the clumsy country girl, for whom two years ago he had cherished
      a pitying affection, threw up upon the horizon of his life and into
      startling clearness a new and absorbing objective. In one brief quarter of
      an hour his life had gathered itself into a single purpose; a purpose, to
      wit, to make a home to which he might bring this girl he had come to love
      with such swift and fierce intensity, to make a home for her where she
      could be his own, and for ever. All the vehement passion of his Highland
      nature was concentrated upon the accomplishing of this purpose. That he
      should ever have come to love Mandy Haley, the overworked slattern on her
      father's Ontario farm, while a thing of wonder, was not the chief wonder
      to him. His wonder now was that he should ever have been so besottedly
      dull of wit and so stupidly unseeing as to allow the unlovely exterior of
      the girl to hide the radiant soul within. That in two brief years she had
      transformed herself into a woman of such perfectly balanced efficiency in
      her profession as nurse, and a creature of such fascinating comeliness,
      was only another proof of his own insensate egotism, and another proof,
      too, of those rare powers that slumbered in the girl's soul unknown to
      herself and to her world. Small wonder that with her unfolding Cameron's
      whole world should become new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard upon this experience the unexpected news of his father's death and of
      the consequent winding up of the tangled affairs of the estate threw upon
      Cameron the responsibility of caring for his young sister, now left alone
      in the Homeland, except for distant kindred of whom they had but slight
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A home was immediately and imperatively necessary, and hence he must at
      once, as a preliminary, be married. Cameron fortunately remembered that
      young Fraser, whom he had known in his Fort Macleod days, was dead keen to
      get rid of the &ldquo;Big Horn Ranch.&rdquo; This ranch lay nestling cozily among the
      foothills and in sight of the towering peaks of the Rockies, and was so
      well watered with little lakes and streams that when his eyes fell upon it
      Cameron was conscious of a sharp pang of homesickness, so suggestive was
      it of the beloved Glen Cuagh Oir of his own Homeland. There would be a
      thousand pounds or more left from his father's estate. Everybody said it
      was a safe, indeed a most profitable investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week's leave of absence sufficed for Cameron to close the deal with
      Fraser, a reckless and gallant young Highlander, whose chivalrous soul,
      kindling at Cameron's romantic story, prompted a generous reduction in the
      price of the ranch and its outfit complete. Hence when Mandy's shrewd and
      experienced head had scanned the contract and cast up the inventory of
      steers and horses, with pigs and poultry thrown in, and had found nothing
      amiss with the deal&mdash;indeed it was rather better than she had hoped&mdash;there
      was no holding of Cameron any longer. Married he would be and without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only drag in the proceedings had come from the Superintendent, who, on
      getting wind of Cameron's purpose, had thought, by promptly promoting him
      from Corporal to Sergeant, to tie him more tightly to the Service and hold
      him, if only for a few months, &ldquo;till this trouble should blow over.&rdquo; But
      Cameron knew of no trouble. The trouble was only in the Superintendent's
      mind, or indeed was only a shrewd scheme to hold Cameron to his duty. A
      rancher he would be, and a famous rancher's wife Mandy would make. And as
      for his sister Moira, had she not highly specialized in pigs and poultry
      on the old home farm at the Cuagh Oir? There was no stopping the
      resistless rush of his passionate purpose. Everything combined to urge him
      on. Even his college mate and one time football comrade of the old
      Edinburgh days, the wise, cool-headed Dr. Martin, now in charge of the
      Canadian Pacific Railway Hospital, as also the little nurse who, through
      those momentous months of Mandy's transforming, had been to her guide,
      philosopher and friend, both had agreed that there was no good reason for
      delay. True, Cameron had no means of getting inside the doctor's mind and
      therefore had no knowledge of the vision that came nightly to torment him
      in his dreams and the memory that came daily to haunt his waking hours; a
      vision and a memory of a trim little figure in a blue serge gown, of eyes
      brown, now sunny with laughing light, now soft with unshed tears, of hair
      that got itself into a most bewildering perplexity of waves and curls, of
      lips curving deliciously, of a voice with a wonderfully soft Highland
      accent; the vision and memory of Moira, Cameron's sister, as she had
      appeared to him in the Glen Cuagh Oir at her father's door. Had Cameron
      known of this tormenting vision and this haunting memory he might have
      questioned the perfect sincerity of his friend's counsel. But Dr. Martin
      kept his secret well and none shared with him his visions and his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there had been only the Superintendent to oppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, because no really valid objection could be offered, the marriage
      was made. And with much shrieking of engines&mdash;it seemed as if all the
      engines with their crews within a hundred miles had gathered to the
      celebration&mdash;with loud thunder of exploding torpedoes, with
      tumultuous cheering of the construction gangs hauled thither on gravel
      trains, with congratulations of railroad officials and of the doctor, with
      the tearful smiles of the little nurse, and with grudging but finally
      hearty good wishes of the Superintendent, they had ridden off down the
      Kootenay Trail for their honeymoon, on their way to the Big Horn Ranch
      some hundreds of miles across the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      There on the Big Horn Ranch through the long summer days together they
      rode the ranges after the cattle, cooking their food in the open and
      camping under the stars where night found them, care-free and deeply
      happy, drinking long full draughts of that mingled wine of life into which
      health and youth and love and God's sweet sun and air poured their rare
      vintage. The world was far away and quite forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer deepened into autumn, the fall round-up was approaching, and there
      came a September day of such limpid light and such nippy sprightly air as
      to suggest to Mandy nothing less than a holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's strike!&rdquo; she cried to her husband, as she looked out toward the
      rolling hills and the overtopping peaks shining clear in the early morning
      light. &ldquo;Let's strike and go a-fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband let his eyes wander over the full curves of her strong and
      supple body and rest upon the face, brown and wholesome, lit with her deep
      blue eyes and crowned with the red-gold masses of her hair, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need a holiday, Mandy. I can see it in the drooping lines of your
      figure, and in the paling of your cheeks. In short,&rdquo; moving toward her,
      &ldquo;you need some one to care for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just at this moment, young man,&rdquo; she cried, darting round the table.
      &ldquo;But, come, what do you say to a day's fishing away up the Little Horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Little Horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know the little creek running into the Big Horn away up the
      gulch where we went one day in the spring. You said there were fish
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but why 'Little Horn,' pray? And who calls it so? I suppose you know
      that the Big Horn gets its name from the Big Horn, the mountain sheep that
      once roamed the rocks yonder, and in that sense there's no Little Horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, 'Little Horn' I call it,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;and shall. And if the big
      stream is the Big Horn, surely the little stream should be the Little
      Horn. But what about the fishing? Is it a go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather! Get the grub, as your Canadian speech hath it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Canadian speech!&rdquo; echoed his wife scornfully. &ldquo;You're just as much
      Canadian as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall get the ponies. Half an hour will do for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And less for me,&rdquo; cried Mandy, dancing off to her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was right. For, clever housekeeper that she was, she stood with
      her hamper packed and the fishing tackle ready long before her husband
      appeared with the ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail led steadily upward through winding valleys, but for the most
      part along the Big Horn, till as it neared a scraggy pine-wood it bore
      sharply to the left, and, clambering round an immense shoulder of rock, it
      emerged upon a long and comparatively level ridge of land that rolled in
      gentle undulations down into a wide park-like valley set out with clumps
      of birch and poplar, with here and there the shimmer of a lake showing
      between the yellow and brown of the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a picture!&rdquo; cried Mandy, reining up her pony. &ldquo;What a ranch that
      would make, Allan! Who owns it? Why did we never come this way before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piegan Reserve,&rdquo; said her husband briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful! How did they get this particular bit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave up a lot for it,&rdquo; said Cameron drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think, such a lovely bit of country for a few Indians! How many are
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some hundreds. Five hundred or so. And a tricky bunch they are. They're
      over-fond of cattle to be really desirable neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it rather a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; cried her husband, sweeping his arm toward the eastern
      horizon. From the height on which they stood a wonderful panorama of hill
      and valley, river, lake and plain lay spread out before them. &ldquo;All that
      and for nine hundred miles beyond that line these Indians and their kin
      gave up to us under persuasion. There was something due them, eh? Let's
      move on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a mile or more the trail ran along the high plateau skirting the
      Piegan Reserve, where it branched sharply to the right. Cameron paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that trail?&rdquo; pointing to the branch that led to the left and
      downward into the valley. &ldquo;That is one of the oldest and most famous of
      all Indian trails. It strikes down through the Crow's Nest Pass and beyond
      the pass joins the ancient Sun Dance Trail. That's my old beat. And weird
      things are a-doing along that same old Sun Dance Trail this blessed minute
      or I miss my guess. I venture to say that this old trail has often been
      marked with blood from end to end in the fierce old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go,&rdquo; said Mandy, with a shudder, and, turning her pony to the
      right, she took the trail that led them down from the plateau, plunged
      into a valley, wound among rocks and thickets of pine till it reached a
      tumbling mountain torrent of gray-blue water, fed from glaciers high up
      between the great peaks beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Little Horn!&rdquo; cried Mandy with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down by its rushing water they scrambled till they came to a sunny glade
      where the little fretful torrent pitched itself headlong into a deep shady
      pool, whence, as if rested in those quiet deeps, it issued at first with
      gentle murmuring till, out of earshot of the pool, it broke again into
      turbulent raging, brawling its way to the Big Horn below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandy could hardly wait for the unloading and tethering of the ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she cried, when all was ready, &ldquo;for my very first fish. How shall I
      fling this hook and where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try a cast yonder, just beside that overhanging willow. Don't splash! Try
      again&mdash;drop it lightly. That's better. Don't tell me you've never
      cast a fly before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it float down a bit. Now back. Hold it up and let it dance there.
      I'll just have a pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But next moment Cameron's pipe was forgotten. With a shout he sprang to
      his wife's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, you've got him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! Leave me alone! Just tell me what to do. Go away! Don't touch me!
      Oh-h-h! He's gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. Reel him up&mdash;reel him up a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't reel the thing! Oh! Oh-h-h! Is he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up. Don't haul him too quickly&mdash;keep him playing. Wait till I
      get the net.&rdquo; He rushed for the landing net.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's gone! He's gone! Oh, I'm so mad!&rdquo; She stamped savagely on the
      grass. &ldquo;He was a monster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always are,&rdquo; said her husband gravely. &ldquo;The fellows that get off, I
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you're just laughing at me, and I won't have it! I could just sit
      down and cry! My very first fish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Mandy, we'll get him or just as good a one again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! He'll never bite again. He isn't such a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they do. They're just like the rest of us. They keep nibbling till
      they get caught; else there would be no fun in fishing or in&mdash;Now try
      another throw&mdash;same place&mdash;a little farther down. Ah! That was a
      fine cast. Once more. No, no, not that way. Flip it lightly and if you
      ever get a bite hold your rod so. See? Press the end against your body so
      that you can reel your fish in. And don't hurry these big fellows. You
      lose them and you lose your fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want the fun,&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;but I do want that fish and I'm
      going to get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, I believe you just will!&rdquo; The young man's dark eyes flashed an
      admiring glance over the strong, supple, swaying figure of the girl at his
      side, whose every move, as she cast her fly, seemed specially designed to
      reveal some new combination of the graceful curves of her well-knit body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep flicking there. You'll get him. He's just sulking. If he only knew,
      he'd hurry up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was fishing for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh! I've got him.&rdquo; The girl was dancing excitedly along the bank.
      &ldquo;No! Oh, what a wretch! He's gone. Now if I get him you tell me what to
      do, but don't touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have to do is to hold him steady at the first. Keep your line
      fairly tight. If he begins to plunge, give him line. If he slacks, reel
      in. Keep him nice and steady, just like a horse on the bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why didn't you tell me before? I know exactly what that means&mdash;just
      like a colt, eh? I can handle a colt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! Now try lower down&mdash;let your fly float down a bit&mdash;there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a wild shriek from the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've got him sure! Now get the net.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't jump about so! Steady now&mdash;steady&mdash;that's better. Fine!
      Fine work! Let him go a bit&mdash;no, check&mdash;wind him up. Look out!
      Not too quick! Fine! Oh! Look out! Get him away from that jam! Reel him
      up! Quick! Now play him! Let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you dare touch this rod, Allan Cameron, or there'll be trouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right&mdash;pardon me&mdash;quite right. Steady! You'll get him
      sure. And he's a beauty, a perfect Rainbow beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet, now,&rdquo; admonished Mandy. &ldquo;Don't shout so. Tell me quietly what
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you like. You can handle him. Just watch and wait&mdash;feel him
      all the time. Ah-h-h! For Heaven's sake don't let him into that jam! There
      he goes up stream! That's better! Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't get so excited! Don't yell so!&rdquo; again admonished Mandy. &ldquo;Tell me
      quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quietly? Who's yelling, I'd like to know? Who's excited? I won't say
      another word. I'll get the landing-net ready for the final act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't leave me! Tell me just what to do. He's getting tired, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch him close. Wind him up a bit. Get all the line in you can. Steady!
      Let go! Let go! Let him run! Now wind him again. Wait, hold him so, just a
      moment&mdash;a little nearer! Hurrah! Hurrah! I've got him and he's a
      beauty&mdash;a perfectly typical Rainbow trout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you beauty!&rdquo; cried Mandy, down on her knees beside the trout that lay
      flapping on the grass. &ldquo;What a shame! Oh, what a shame! Oh, put him in
      again, Allan, I don't want him. Poor dear, what a shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must weigh him, you see,&rdquo; remonstrated her husband. &ldquo;And we need
      him for tea, you know. He really doesn't feel it much. There are lots
      more. Try another cast. I'll attend to this chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel just like a murderer,&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;But isn't it glorious? Well,
      I'll just try one more. Aren't you going to get your rod out too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather! What a pool, all unspoiled, all unfished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does no one fish up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Police come at times from the Fort. And Wyckham, our neighbor.
      And old man Thatcher, a born angler, though he says it's not sport, but
      murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not sport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Old Thatcher said to me one day, 'Them fish would climb a tree to
      get at your hook. That ain't no sport.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But sport, and noble sport, they found it through the long afternoon, so
      that, when through the scraggy pines the sun began to show red in the
      western sky, a score or more lusty, glittering, speckled Rainbow trout lay
      on the grass beside the shady pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired with their sport, they lay upon the grassy sward, luxuriating in the
      warm sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Allan,&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;I'll make tea ready if you get some wood for
      the fire. You ought to be thankful I taught you how to use the ax. Do you
      remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thankful? Well, I should say. Do YOU remember that day, Mandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; cried the girl, with horror in her tone. &ldquo;Oh, don't speak of
      it. It's too awful to think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awful what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; she shuddered, &ldquo;I can't bear to think of it. I wish you could
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? How can you ask? That awful, horrid, uncouth, sloppy girl.&rdquo; Again
      Mandy shuddered. &ldquo;Those hands, big, coarse, red, ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Allan savagely, &ldquo;the badge of slavery for a whole household
      of folk too ignorant to know the price that was being paid for the service
      rendered them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the hair,&rdquo; continued Mandy relentlessly, &ldquo;uncombed, filthy, horrid.
      And the dress, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; cried Allan peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let me go on. The stupid face, the ignorant mind, the uncouth speech,
      the vulgar manners. Oh, I loathe the picture, and I wonder you can ever
      bear to look at her again. And, oh, I wish you could forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget!&rdquo; The young man's lean, swarthy face seemed to light up with the
      deep glowing fires in his dark eyes. His voice grew vibrant. &ldquo;Forget!
      Never while I live. Do you know what <i>I</i> remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, spare me!&rdquo; moaned his wife, putting her hands over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what <i>I</i> remember?&rdquo; he repeated, pulling her hands away
      and holding them fast. &ldquo;A girl with hands, face, hair, form, dress,
      manners damned to coarseness by a cruel environment? That? No! No! To-day
      as I look back I remember only two blue eyes, deep, deep as wells, soft,
      blue, and wonderfully kind. And I remember all through those days&mdash;and
      hard days they were to a green young fool fresh from the Old Country
      trying to keep pace with your farm-bred demon-worker Perkins&mdash;I
      remember all through those days a girl that never was too tired with her
      own unending toil to think of others, and especially to help out with many
      a kindness a home-sick, hand-sore, foot-sore stranger who hardly knew a
      buck-saw from a turnip hoe, and was equally strange to the uses of both, a
      girl that feared no shame nor harm in showing her kindness. That's what I
      remember. A girl that made life bearable to a young fool, too proud to
      recognize his own limitations, too blind to see the gifts the gods were
      flinging at him. Oh, what a fool I was with my silly pride of family, of
      superior education and breeding, and with no eye for the pure gold of as
      true and loyal a soul as ever offered itself in daily unmurmuring
      sacrifice for others, and without a thought of sacrifice. Fool and dolt! A
      self-sufficient prig! That's what I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl tore her hands away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Allan, my boy,&rdquo; she cried with a shrill and scornful laugh that broke
      at the end, &ldquo;how foolishly you talk! And yet I love to hear you talk so. I
      love to hear you. But, oh, let me tell you what else I remember of those
      days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I will not listen. It's all nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Ah, Allan! Let me tell you this once.&rdquo; She put her hands upon
      his shoulders and looked steadily into his eyes. &ldquo;Let me tell you. I've
      never told you once during these six happy months&mdash;oh, how happy, I
      fear to think how happy, too much joy, too deep, too wonderful, I'm afraid
      sometimes&mdash;but let me tell you what I see, looking back into those
      old days&mdash;how far away they seem already and not yet three years past&mdash;I
      see a lad so strange, so unlike all I had known, a gallant lad, a very
      knight for grace and gentleness, strong and patient and brave, not afraid&mdash;ah,
      that caught me&mdash;nothing could make him afraid, not Perkins, the
      brutal bully, not big Mack himself. And this young lad, beating them all
      in the things men love to do, running, the hammer&mdash;and&mdash;and
      fighting too!&mdash;Oh, laddie, laddie, how often did I hold my hands over
      my heart for fear it would burst for pride in you! How often did I check
      back my tears for very joy of loving you! How often did I find myself sick
      with the agony of fear that you should go away from me forever! And then
      you went away, oh, so kindly, so kindly pitiful, your pity stabbing my
      heart with every throb. Why do I tell you this to-day? Let me go through
      it. But it was this very pity stabbing me that awoke in me the resolve
      that one day you would not need to pity me. And then, then I fled from the
      farm and all its dreadful surroundings. And the nurse and Dr. Martin, oh
      how good they were! And all of them helped me. They taught me. They
      scolded me. They were never tired telling me. And with that flame burning
      in my soul all that outer, horrid, awful husk seemed to disappear and I
      escaped, I became all new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You became yourself, yourself, your glorious, splendid, beautiful self!&rdquo;
       shouted Allan, throwing his arms around her. &ldquo;And then I found you again.
      Thank God, I found you! And found you for keeps, mine forever. Think of
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever.&rdquo; Mandy shuddered again. &ldquo;Oh, Allan, I'm somehow afraid. This joy
      is too great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, forever,&rdquo; said Allan again, but more quietly, &ldquo;for love will last
      forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they sat upon the grass, needing no words to speak the joy that
      filled their souls to overflowing. Suddenly Mandy sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let me go, for within an hour we must be away. Oh, what a day we've
      had, Allan, one of the very best days in all my life! You know I've never
      been able to talk of the past to you, but to-day somehow I could not rest
      till I had gone through with it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's been a great day,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;a wonderful day, a day we shall
      always remember.&rdquo; Then after a silence, &ldquo;Now for a fire and supper. You're
      right. In an hour we must be gone, for we are a long way from home. But,
      think of it, Mandy, we're going HOME. I can't quite get used to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in an hour, riding close as lovers ride, they took the trail to their
      home ten miles away.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BIG CHIEF
    </h3>
    <p>
      When on the return journey they arrived upon the plateau skirting the
      Piegan Reserve the sun's rays were falling in shafts of slanting light
      upon the rounded hilltops before them and touching with purple the great
      peaks behind them. The valleys were full of shadows, deep and blue. The
      broad plains that opened here and there between the rounded hills were
      still bathed in the mellow light of the westering sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will keep out a bit from the Reserve,&rdquo; said Cameron, taking a trail
      that led off to the left. &ldquo;These Piegans are none too friendly. I've had
      to deal with them a few times about my straying steers in a way which they
      are inclined to resent. This half-breed business is making them all
      restless and a good deal too impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not any real danger, is there?&rdquo; inquired his wife. &ldquo;The Police
      can handle them quite well, can't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were a silly hysterical girl, Mandy, I would say 'no danger' of
      course. But the signs are ominous. I don't fear anything immediately, but
      any moment a change may come and then we shall need to act quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall ride to the Fort, I can tell you, without waiting to take our
      stuff with us. I take no chances now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now? Meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning my wife, that's all. I never thought to fear an Indian, but, by
      Jove! since I've got you, Mandy, they make me nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these Piegans are such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Piegans are Indians, plain Indians, deprived of the privilege of war
      by our North West Mounted Police regulations and of the excitement of the
      chase by our ever approaching civilization, and the younger bloods would
      undoubtedly welcome a 'bit of a divarshun,' as your friend Mike would say.
      At present the Indians are simply watching and waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News. To see which way the cat jumps. Then&mdash;Steady, Ginger! What the
      deuce! Whoa, I say! Hold hard, Mandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something in the bushes yonder. Coyote, probably. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came from a thick clump of poplars a low, moaning cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;It sounds like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are. I'll ride in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments she heard his voice calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along! Hurry up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young Indian lad of about seventeen, ghastly under his copper skin and
      faint from loss of blood, lay with his ankle held in a powerful wolf-trap,
      a bloody knife at his side. With a cry Mandy was off her horse and beside
      him, the instincts of the trained nurse rousing her to action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! What a mess!&rdquo; cried Cameron, looking helplessly upon the
      bloody and mangled leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a pail of water and get a fire going, Allan,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, first this trap ought to be taken off, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking his ax from their camp outfit, he cut down a sapling, and, using it
      as a lever, soon released the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did all this mangling come?&rdquo; said Mandy, gazing at the limb, the
      flesh and skin of which were hanging in shreds about the ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutting it off, weren't you?&rdquo; said Allan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandy lifted the foot up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian uttered not a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Bring a pail of water and get a fire going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allan was soon back with the pail of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me&mdash;water,&rdquo; moaned the Indian, pointing to the pail. Allan held it
      to his lips and he drank long and deep. In a short time the fire was
      blazing and the tea pail slung over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only had my kit here!&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;This torn flesh and skin ought
      to be all cut away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Mandy, you can't do that. We'll get the Police doctor!&rdquo; said
      Allan in a tone of horrified disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mandy was feeling the edge of the Indian's knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharp enough,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;These ragged edges are just reeking
      with poison. Can you stand it if I cut these bits off?&rdquo; she said to the
      Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he replied with a grunt of contempt. &ldquo;No hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mandy, you can't do this! It makes me sick to see you,&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian glanced with scorn at him, caught the knife out of Mandy's
      hand, took up a flap of lacerated flesh and cut it clean away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! No-t'ing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy took the knife from him, and, after boiling it for a few minutes,
      proceeded to cut away the ragged, mangled flesh and skin. The Indian never
      winced. He lay with eyes closed, and so pallid was his face and so
      perfectly motionless his limbs that he might have been dead. With deft
      hands she cleansed the wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Allan, you must help me. We must have splints for this ankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would birch-bark do?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's too flimsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heavy inner rind is fairly stiff.&rdquo; He ran to a tree and hacked off a
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will do splendidly. Get some about so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour's work, and the wounded limb lay cleansed, bandaged, packed
      in soft moss and bound in splints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's great, Mandy!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband. &ldquo;Even to my untutored eyes
      that looks like an artistic bit of work. You're a wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the Indian. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; His piercing black eyes were lifted
      suddenly to her face with such a look of gratitude as is seen in the eyes
      of dumb brutes or of men deprived of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; echoed Allan. &ldquo;You're just right, my boy. I couldn't have done it,
      I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the Indian in eloquent contempt. &ldquo;No good,&rdquo; pointing to the
      man. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; pointing to the woman. &ldquo;Me&mdash;no&mdash;forget.&rdquo; He lifted
      himself upon his elbow, and, pointing to the sun like a red eye glaring in
      upon them through a vista of woods and hills, said, &ldquo;Look&mdash;He see&mdash;me
      no forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something truly Hebraic in the exultant solemnity of his tone
      and gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! He won't either, I truly believe,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;You've made a
      friend for life, Mandy. Now, what's next? We can't carry this chap. It's
      three miles to their camp. We can't leave him here. There are wolves all
      around and the brutes always attack anything wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian solved the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted contemptuously. He took up his long hunting-knife. &ldquo;Wolf&mdash;this!&rdquo;
       He drove the knife to the hilt into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go&mdash;my fadder come. T'ree Indian,&rdquo; holding up three fingers.
      &ldquo;All right! Good!&rdquo; He sank back upon the ground exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on then, Mandy, we shall have to hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you go. I'll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't have that. It will be dark soon and I can't leave you here alone
      with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! This poor boy is faint with hunger and pain. I'll feed him
      while you're gone. Get me afresh pail of water and I can do for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied her husband dubiously, &ldquo;I'll get you some wood and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; replied Mandy impatiently, &ldquo;who taught you to cut wood? I can
      get my own wood. The main thing is to get away and get back. This boy
      needs shelter. How long have you been here?&rdquo; she inquired of the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy opened his eyes and swung his arm twice from east to west,
      indicating the whole sweep of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be starving. Want to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, then, Allan, with the water. By the time this lad has been fed you
      will be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before Allan was back with the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he said to the Indian, &ldquo;where's your camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian with his knife drew a line upon the ground. &ldquo;River,&rdquo; he said.
      Another line parallel, &ldquo;Trail.&rdquo; Then, tracing a branching line from the
      latter, turning sharply to the right, &ldquo;Big Hill,&rdquo; he indicated. &ldquo;Down&mdash;down.&rdquo;
       Then, running the line a little farther, &ldquo;Here camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the spot,&rdquo; cried Allan. &ldquo;Well, I'm off. Are you quite sure, Mandy,
      you don't mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run off with you and get back soon. Go&mdash;good-by! Oh! Stop, you
      foolish boy! Aren't you ashamed of yourself before&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron laughed in happy derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed? No, nor before his whole tribe.&rdquo; He swung himself on his pony
      and was off down the trail at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You' man?&rdquo; inquired the Indian lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my man,&rdquo; pride ringing in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Him Big Chief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Yes.&rdquo; She corrected herself hastily. &ldquo;Big Chief. Ranch, you know&mdash;Big
      Horn Ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; He closed his eyes and sank back again upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're faint with hunger, poor boy,&rdquo; said Mandy. She hastily cut a large
      slice of bread, buttered it, laid upon it some bacon and handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take this in the meantime,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll have your tea in a
      jiffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy took the bread, and, faint though he was with hunger, sternly
      repressing all sign of haste, he ate it with grave deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more the tea was ready and Mandy brought him a cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said, drinking it slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another?&rdquo; she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he replied, drinking the second cup more rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we'll have some fish,&rdquo; cried Mandy cheerily, &ldquo;and then you'll be fit
      for your journey home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In twenty minutes more she brought him a frying pan in which two large
      beautiful trout lay, browned in butter. Mandy caught the wolf-like look in
      his eyes as they fell upon the food. She cut several thick slices of
      bread, laid them in the pan with the fish and turned her back upon him.
      The Indian seized the bread, and, noting that he was unobserved, tore it
      apart like a dog and ate ravenously, the fish likewise, ripping the flesh
      off the bones and devouring it like some wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; she said, when he had finished, &ldquo;you've had enough to keep
      you going. Indeed, you have had all that's good for you. We don't want any
      fever, so that will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gestures, if not her words, he understood, and again as he watched her
      there gleamed in his eyes that dumb animal look of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, slapping himself on the chest and arms. &ldquo;Good! Me
      strong! Me sleep.&rdquo; He lay back upon the ground and in half a dozen breaths
      was dead asleep, leaving Mandy to her lonely watch in the gathering gloom
      of the falling night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of the woods deepened into a stillness so profound that a dead
      leaf, fluttering from its twig and rustling to the ground, made her start
      in quick apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; she muttered angrily. She rose to pile wood upon the
      fire. At her first movement the Indian was broad awake and half on his
      knees with his knife gleaming in his hand. As his eyes fell upon the girl
      at the fire, with a grunt, half of pain and half of contempt, he sank back
      again upon the ground and was fast asleep before the fire was mended,
      leaving Mandy once more to her lonely watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would come,&rdquo; she muttered, peering into the darkening woods
      about her. A long and distant howl seemed to reply to her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was answered by a series of short, sharp yelps nearer at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coyote,&rdquo; she said disdainfully, for she had learned to despise the
      cowardly prairie wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again that long distant howl. In spite of herself she shuddered. That
      was no coyote, but a gray timber wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Allan would come,&rdquo; she said again, thinking of wakening the
      Indian. But her nurse's instincts forbade her breaking his heavy sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy, he needs the rest! I'll wait a while longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her ax and went bravely at some dead wood lying near, cutting it
      for the fire. The Indian never made a sound. He lay dead in sleep. She
      piled the wood on the fire till the flames leaped high, shining ruddily
      upon the golden and yellow leaves of the surrounding trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again that long-drawn howl, and quite near, pierced the silence like
      the thrust of a spear. Before she was aware Mandy was on her feet,
      determined to waken the sleeping Indian, but she had no more than taken a
      single step toward him when he was awake and listening keenly. A soft
      padding upon the dead leaves could be heard like the gentle falling of
      raindrops. The Indian rolled over on his side, swept away some dead leaves
      and moss, and drew toward him a fine Winchester rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Wolf,&rdquo; he said, with quiet unconcern. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, pointing
      to a rock beside him. Mandy took the place indicated. As she seated
      herself he put up his hand with a sharp hiss. Again the pattering feet
      could be heard. Suddenly the Indian leaned forward, gazing intently into
      the gloom beyond the rim of the firelight, then with a swift gliding
      movement he threw his rifle up and fired. There was a sharp yelp, followed
      by a gurgling snarl. His shot was answered by a loud shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said the lad with quiet satisfaction, holding up one finger, &ldquo;One
      wolf. Big Chief come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the shout Mandy had sprung to her feet, answering with a loud glad
      halloo. Immediately, as if in response to her call, an Indian swung his
      pony into the firelight, slipped off and stood looking about him.
      Straight, tall and sinewy, he stood, with something noble in his face and
      bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a gentleman,&rdquo; was the thought that leaped into Mandy's
      mind. A swift glance he swept round the circle of the light. Mandy thought
      she had never seen so piercing an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian lad uttered a low moaning sound. With a single leap the man was
      at his side, holding him in his arms and kissing him on both cheeks, with
      eager guttural speech. A few words from the lad and the Indian was on his
      feet again, his eyes gleaming, but his face immobile as a death mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the lad. &ldquo;My boy&mdash;my papoose.&rdquo; His
      voice grew soft and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mandy could reply there was another shout and Allan, followed by
      four Indians, burst into the light. With a glad cry Mandy rushed into his
      arms and clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! What's up? Everything all right?&rdquo; cried Allan. &ldquo;I was a deuce of a
      time, I know. Took the wrong trail. You weren't frightened, eh? What?
      What's happened?&rdquo; His voice grew anxious, then stern. &ldquo;Anything wrong? Did
      he&mdash;? Did anyone&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Allan!&rdquo; cried his wife, still clinging to him. &ldquo;It was only a
      wolf and I was a little frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wolf!&rdquo; echoed her husband aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian lad spoke a few words and pointed to the dark. The Indians
      glided into the woods and in a few minutes one of them returned, dragging
      by the leg a big, gray timber wolf. The lad's bullet had gone home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did this brute attack you?&rdquo; cried Allan in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I heard him howling a long way off, and then&mdash;then&mdash;he
      came nearer, and&mdash;then&mdash;I could hear his feet pattering.&rdquo;
       Cameron drew her close to him. &ldquo;And then he saw him right in the dark.
      Wasn't it wonderful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dark?&rdquo; said Allan, turning to the lad. &ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the lad in a tone of indifference. &ldquo;See him eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already the Indians were preparing a stretcher out of blankets and two
      saplings. Here Mandy came to their help, directing their efforts so that
      with the least hurt to the boy he was lifted to his stretcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were departing the father came close to Mandy, and, holding out
      his hand, said in fairly good English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;good to my boy. You save him&mdash;to-day. All alone maybe he
      die. You give him food&mdash;drink. Sometime&mdash;perhaps soon&mdash;me
      pay you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;I want no pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No money&mdash;no!&rdquo; cried the Indian, with scorn in his voice. &ldquo;Me save
      you perhaps&mdash;sometime. Save you&mdash;save you, man. Me Big Chief.&rdquo;
       He drew himself up his full height. &ldquo;Much Indian follow me.&rdquo; He shook
      hands with Mandy again, then with her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Piegan Chief?&rdquo; inquired her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piegan!&rdquo; said the Indian with hearty contempt. &ldquo;Me no Piegan&mdash;me Big
      Chief. Me&mdash;&rdquo; He paused abruptly, turned on his heel and, flinging
      himself on to his pony, disappeared in the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's jolly well pleased with himself, isn't he?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's splendid,&rdquo; cried Mandy enthusiastically. &ldquo;Why, he's just like one of
      Cooper's Indians. He's certainly like none of the rest I've seen about
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true enough,&rdquo; replied her husband. &ldquo;He's no Piegan. Who is he, I
      wonder? I don't remember seeing him. He thinks no end of himself, at any
      rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And looks as if he had a right to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are! Well, let's away. You must be dog tired and used up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a bit,&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;I'm fresh as a daisy. What a wonderful ending
      to a wonderful day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They extinguished the fire carefully and made their way out to the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the end of this wonderful day had not yet come.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ANCIENT SACRIFICE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The moon was riding high in the cloudless blue of the heavens, tricked out
      with faintly shining stars, when they rode into the &ldquo;corral&rdquo; that
      surrounded the ranch stable. A horse stood tethered at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, a visitor!&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;A Police horse!&rdquo; his eyes falling upon
      the shining accouterments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Policeman!&rdquo; echoed Mandy, a sudden foreboding at her heart. &ldquo;What can
      he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, likely,&rdquo; replied her husband with a laugh, &ldquo;though I can't think for
      which of my crimes it is. It's Inspector Dickson, by his horse. You know
      him, Mandy, my very best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want, Allan?&rdquo; said Mandy, anxiety in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want? Any one of a thousand things. You run in and see while I put up the
      ponies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like it,&rdquo; said Mandy, walking with him toward the stable. &ldquo;Do you
      know, I feel there is something&mdash;I have felt all day a kind of dread
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Mandy! You're not that style of girl. Run away into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But still Mandy waited beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've had a great day, Allan,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Many great days, and
      this, one of the best. Whatever comes nothing can take those happy days
      from us.&rdquo; She put her arms about his neck and drew him toward her. &ldquo;I
      don't know why, Allan, I know it's foolish, but I'm afraid,&rdquo; she
      whispered, &ldquo;I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mandy,&rdquo; said her husband, with his arms round about her, &ldquo;don't say
      you're going to get like other girls, hysterical and that sort of thing.
      You are just over-tired. We've had a big day, but an exhausting day, an
      exciting day. What with that Piegan and the wolf business and all, you are
      done right up. So am I and&mdash;by Jove! That reminds me, I am dead
      famished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No better word could he have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor boy,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'll have supper ready by the time you come
      in. I am silly, but now it's all over. I shall go in and face the
      Inspector and dare him to arrest you, no matter what you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's more like the thing! That's more like my girl. I shall be with you
      in a very few minutes. He can't take us both, can he? Run in and smile at
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy found the Inspector in the cozy ranch kitchen, calmly smoking his
      pipe, and deep in the London Graphic. As she touched the latch he sprang
      to his feet and saluted in his best style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard you ride up, Mrs. Cameron, I assure you. You must think me
      rather cool to sit tight here and ignore your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to see you, Inspector Dickson, and Allan will be
      delighted. He is putting up your horse. You will of course stay the night
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's awfully kind, but I really can't, you know. I shall tell
      Cameron.&rdquo; He took his hat from the peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be delighted if you could stay with us. We see very few people
      and you have not been very neighborly, now confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been, and to my sorrow and loss. If any man had told me that I
      should have been just five weeks to a day within a few hours' ride of my
      friend Cameron, not to speak of his charming wife, without visiting him,
      well I should have&mdash;well, no matter&mdash;to my joy I am here
      to-night. But I can't stay this trip. We are rather hard worked just now,
      to tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard worked?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Patrol work rather heavy. But I must stop Cameron in his hospitable
      design,&rdquo; he added, as he passed out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a full half hour before the men returned, to find supper spread and
      Mandy waiting. It was a large and cheerful apartment that did both for
      kitchen and living room. The sides were made of logs hewn smooth,
      plastered and whitewashed. The oak joists and planking above were stained
      brown. At one end of the kitchen two doors led to as many rooms, at the
      other a large stone fireplace, with a great slab for mantelpiece. On this
      slab stood bits of china bric-a-brac, and what not, relics abandoned by
      the gallant and chivalrous Fraser for the bride and her house furnishing.
      The prints, too, upon the wall, hunting scenes of the old land,
      sea-scenes, moorland and wild cattle, with many useful and ornamental bits
      of furniture, had all been handed over with true Highland generosity by
      the outgoing owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fireplace, for the night had a touch of frost in it, a log fire
      blazed and sparked, lending to the whole scene an altogether delightful
      air of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, this does look jolly!&rdquo; cried the Inspector as he entered.
      &ldquo;Cameron, you lucky dog, do you really imagine you know how jolly well off
      you are, coddled thus in the lap of comfort and surrounded with all the
      enervating luxuries of an effete and forgotten civilization? Come now, own
      up, you are beginning to take this thing as a matter of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cameron stood with his back to the light, busying himself with his
      fishing tackle and fish, and ignoring the Inspector's cheerful chatter.
      And thus he remained without a word while the Inspector talked on in a
      voluble flow of small talk quite unusual with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the supper Cameron remained silent, rallying spasmodically with
      gay banter to the Inspector's chatter, or answering at random, but always
      falling silent again, and altogether was so unlike himself that Mandy fell
      to wondering, then became watchful, then anxious. At length the Inspector
      himself fell silent, as if perceiving the uselessness of further pretense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Allan?&rdquo; said Mandy quietly, when silence had fallen upon them
      all. &ldquo;You might as well let me know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her, for God's sake,&rdquo; said her husband to the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector handed her a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Superintendent Strong to my Chief,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it and as she read her face went now white with fear, now red
      with indignation. At length she flung the letter down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man he is to be sure!&rdquo; she cried scornfully. &ldquo;And what nonsense is
      this he writes. With all his men and officers he must come for my husband!
      What is HE doing? And all the others? It's just his own stupid
      stubbornness. He always did object to our marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector was silent. Cameron was silent too. His boyish face, for he
      was but a lad, seemed to have grown old in those few minutes. The
      Inspector wore an ashamed look, as if detected in a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And because he is not clever enough to catch this man they must come for
      my husband to do it for them. He is not a Policeman. He has nothing to do
      with the Force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still the Inspector sat silent, as if convicted of both crime and
      folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Cameron spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite impossible, Inspector. I can't do it. You quite see how
      impossible it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly you can't,&rdquo; eagerly agreed the Inspector. &ldquo;I knew from the
      first it was a piece of&mdash;sheer absurdity&mdash;in fact brutal
      inhumanity. I told the Commissioner so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't as if I was really needed, you know. The Superintendent's idea
      is, as you say, quite absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector gravely nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think for a moment,&rdquo; continued Cameron, &ldquo;there is any need&mdash;any
      real need I mean&mdash;for me to&mdash;&rdquo; Cameron's voice died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector hesitated and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Well&mdash;of course, we
      are desperately short-handed, you know. Every man is overworked. Every
      reserve has to be closely patroled. Every trail ought to be watched.
      Runners are coming in every day. We ought to have a thousand men instead
      of five hundred, this very minute. Of course one can never tell. The
      chances are this will all blow over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;We've heard these rumors for the past year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed the Inspector cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it does not,&rdquo; asked Mandy, suddenly facing the Inspector, &ldquo;what
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it does not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it does not?&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector appeared to turn the matter over in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said slowly and thoughtfully, &ldquo;if it does not there will be a
      deuce of an ugly time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. But Mandy waited, her eyes fixed on
      his face demanding answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are some hundreds of settlers and their families scattered
      over this country, and we can hardly protect them all. But,&rdquo; he added
      cheerfully, as if dismissing the subject, &ldquo;we have a trick of worrying
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy shuddered. One phrase in the Superintendent's letter to the
      Commissioner which she had just read kept hammering upon her brain,
      &ldquo;Cameron is the man and the only man for the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned the talk to other things, but the subject would not be
      dismissed. Like the ghost at the feast it kept ever returning. The
      Inspector retailed the most recent rumors, and together he and his host
      weighed their worth. The Inspector disclosed the Commissioner's plans as
      far as he knew them. These, too, were discussed with approval or
      condemnation. The consequences of an Indian uprising were hinted at, but
      quickly dropped. The probabilities of such an uprising were touched upon
      and pronounced somewhat slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow to the woman listening as in a maze this pronouncement and all
      the reassuring talk rang hollow. She sat staring at the Inspector with
      eyes that saw him not. What she did see was a picture out of an old book
      of Indian war days which she had read when a child, a smoking cabin, with
      mangled forms of women and children lying in the blackened embers. By
      degrees, slow, painful, but relentlessly progressive, certain impressions,
      at first vague and passionately resisted, were wrought into convictions in
      her soul. First, the Inspector, in spite of his light talk, was undeniably
      anxious, and in this anxiety her husband shared. Then, the Force was
      clearly inadequate to the duty required of it. At this her indignation
      burned. Why should it be that a Government should ask of brave men what
      they must know to be impossible? Hard upon this conviction came the words
      of the Superintendent, &ldquo;Cameron is the man and the only man for the job.&rdquo;
       Finally, the Inspector was apologizing for her husband. It roused a hot
      resentment in her to hear him. That thing she could not and would not
      bear. Never should it be said that her husband had needed a friend to
      apologize for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these convictions grew in clearness she found herself brought suddenly
      and sharply to face the issue. With a swift contraction of the heart she
      realized that she must send her husband on this perilous duty. Ah! Could
      she do it? It was as if a cold hand were steadily squeezing drop by drop
      the life-blood from her heart. In contrast, and as if with one flash of
      light, the long happy days of the last six months passed before her mind.
      How could she give him up? Her breathing came in short gasps, her lips
      became dry, her eyes fixed and staring. She was fighting for what was
      dearer to her than life. Suddenly she flung her hands to her face and
      groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mandy?&rdquo; cried her husband, starting from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words seemed to recall her. The agonizing agitation passed from her
      and a great quiet fell upon her soul. The struggle was done. She had made
      the ancient sacrifice demanded of women since ever the first man went
      forth to war. It remained only to complete with fitting ritual this
      ancient sacrifice. She rose from her seat and faced her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was of indescribable sweetness, &ldquo;you must
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband took her in his arms without a word, then brokenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My girl! My own brave girl! I knew you must send me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, gazing into his face with a wan smile, &ldquo;I knew it too,
      because I knew you would expect me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector had risen from his chair at her first cry and was standing
      with bent head, as if in the presence of a scene too sacred to witness.
      Then he came to her, and, with old time and courtly grace of the fine
      gentleman he was, he took her hand and raised it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for such as you brave men would gladly give their
      lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give their lives!&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;I would much rather they would save
      them. But,&rdquo; she added, her voice taking a practical tone, &ldquo;sit down and
      let us talk. Now what's the work and what's the plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men glanced at each other in silent admiration of this woman who,
      without moan or murmur, could surrender her heart's dearest treasure for
      her country's good. This was a spirit of their own type.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down before the fire and discussed the business before them. But
      as they discussed ever and again Mandy would find her mind wandering back
      over the past happy days. Ever and again a word would recall her, but only
      for a brief moment and soon she was far away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A phrase of the Inspector, however, arrested and held her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's really a fine looking Indian, in short a kind of aristocrat among
      the Indians,&rdquo; he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An aristocrat?&rdquo; she exclaimed, remembering her own word about the Indian
      Chief they had met that very evening. &ldquo;Why, that is like our Chief,
      Allan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! You're right!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband. &ldquo;What's your man like,
      again? Describe him, Inspector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector described him in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very man we saw to-night!&rdquo; cried Mandy, and gave her description of
      the &ldquo;Big Chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished the Inspector sat looking into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the Piegans, too,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;That fits in. There was a big powwow
      the other day in the Sun Dance Canyon. The Piegans' is the nearest
      reserve, and a lot of them were there. The Superintendent says he is
      somewhere along the Sun Dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspector,&rdquo; said Allan, with sudden determination, &ldquo;we will drop in on
      the Piegans to-morrow morning by sun-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy started. This pace was more rapid than she had expected, but, having
      made the sacrifice, there was with her no word of recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector pondered the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would do no harm to reconnoiter at any rate. But we
      can't afford to make any false move, and we can't afford to fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fail!&rdquo; said Cameron quietly. &ldquo;We won't fail. We'll get him.&rdquo; And the
      lines in his face reminded his wife of how he looked that night three
      years before when he cowed the great bully Perkins into submission at her
      father's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long they sat and planned. As the Inspector said, there must be no
      failure; hence the plan must provide for every possible contingency. By
      far the keenest of the three in mental activity was Mandy. By a curious
      psychological process the Indian Chief, who an hour before had awakened in
      her admiration and a certain romantic interest, had in a single moment
      become an object of loathing, almost of hatred. That he should be in this
      land planning for her people, for innocent and defenseless women and
      children, the horrors of massacre filled her with a fierce anger. But a
      deeper analysis would doubtless have revealed a personal element in her
      anger and loathing. The Indian had become the enemy for whose capture and
      for whose destruction her husband was now enlisted. Deep down in her
      quiet, strong, self-controlled nature there burned a passion in which
      mingled the primitive animal instincts of the female, mate for mate, and
      mother for offspring. Already her mind had leaped forward to the moment
      when this cunning, powerful plotter would be at death-grips with her
      husband and she not there to help. With intensity of purpose and
      relentlessness of determination she focused the powers of her forceful and
      practical mind upon the problem engaging their thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      With mind whetted to its keenest she listened to the men as they made and
      unmade their plans. In ordinary circumstances the procedure of arrest
      would have been extremely simple. The Inspector and Cameron would have
      ridden into the Piegan camp, and, demanding their man, would have quietly
      and without even a show of violence carried him off. It would have been
      like things they had each of them done single-handed within the past year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When once we make a start, you see, Mrs. Cameron, we never turn back. We
      could not afford to,&rdquo; said the Inspector. There was no suspicion of
      boasting in the Inspector's voice. He was simply enunciating the
      traditional code of the Police. &ldquo;And if we should hesitate with this man
      or fail to land him every Indian in these territories would have it within
      a week and our prestige would receive a shock. We dare not exhibit any
      sign of nerves. On the other hand we dare not make any movement in force.
      In short, anything unusual must be avoided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite see,&rdquo; replied Mandy with keen appreciation of the delicacy of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I fancy the simpler the plan the better. Cameron will ride into
      the Piegan camp inquiring about his cattle, as, fortunately for the
      present situation, he has cause enough to in quite an ordinary way. I drop
      in on my regular patrol looking up a cattle-thief in quite the ordinary
      way. Seeing this strange chief, I arrest him on suspicion. Cameron backs
      me up. The thing is done. Luckily Trotting Wolf, who is the Head Chief now
      of the Piegans, has a fairly thorough respect for the Police, and unless
      things have gone much farther in his band than I think he will not resist.
      He is, after all, rather harmless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like your plan at all, Inspector,&rdquo; said Mandy promptly. &ldquo;The
      moment you suggest arrest that moment the younger men will be up. They are
      just back from a big brave-making powwow, you say. They are all worked up,
      and keen for a chance to prove that they are braves in more than in name.
      You give them the very opportunity you wish to avoid. Now hear my plan,&rdquo;
       she continued, her voice eager, keen, hard, in the intensity of her
      purpose. &ldquo;I ride into camp to-morrow morning to see the sick boy. I
      promised I would and I really want to. I find him in a fever, for a fever
      he certainly will have. I dress his wounded ankle and discover he must
      have some medicine. I get old Copperhead to ride back with me for it. You
      wait here and arrest him without trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other, then at her, with a gentle admiring
      pity. The plan was simplicity itself and undoubtedly eliminated the
      elements of danger which the Inspector's possessed. It had, however, one
      fatal defect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, Mandy!&rdquo; said her husband, reaching across the table and patting her
      hand that lay clenched upon the cloth. &ldquo;But it won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, pray?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not use our women as decoys in this country, nor do we expose them
      to dangers we men dare not face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; cried his wife with angry impatience, &ldquo;you miss the whole point.
      For a woman to ride into the Piegan camp, especially on this errand of
      mercy, involves her in no danger. And what possible danger would there be
      in having the old villain ride back with me for medicine? And as to the
      decoy business,&rdquo; here she shrugged her shoulders contemptuously, &ldquo;do you
      think I care a bit for that? Isn't he planning to kill women and children
      in this country? And&mdash;and&mdash;won't he do his best to kill you?&rdquo;
       she panted. &ldquo;Isn't it right for me to prevent him? Prevent him! To me he
      is like a snake. I would&mdash;would&mdash;gladly kill him&mdash;myself.&rdquo;
       As she spoke these words her eyes were indeed, in Sergeant Ferry's words,
      &ldquo;like little blue flames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the men remained utterly unmoved. To their manhood the plan was
      repugnant, and in spite of Mandy's arguments and entreaties was rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the better plan, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said the Inspector kindly, &ldquo;but we
      cannot, you must see we cannot, adopt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you will not,&rdquo; cried Mandy indignantly, &ldquo;just because you are
      stupid stubborn men!&rdquo; And she proceeded to argue the matter all over again
      with convincing logic, but with the same result. There are propositions
      which do not lend themselves to the arbitrament of logic with men. When
      the safety of their women is at stake they refuse to discuss chances. In
      such a case they may be stupid, but they are quite immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blocked by this immovable stupidity, Mandy yielded her ground, but only to
      attempt a flank movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go with you on your reconnoitering expedition,&rdquo; she pleaded.
      &ldquo;Rather, let US go, Allan, you and I together, to see the boy. I am really
      sorry for that boy. He can't help his father, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said the Inspector gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go and find out all we can and next day make your attempt.
      Besides, Allan,&rdquo; she cried under a sudden inspiration of memory, &ldquo;you
      can't possibly go. You forget your sister arrives at Calgary this week.
      You must meet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! Is that so? I had forgotten,&rdquo; said Cameron, turning to study the
      calendar on the wall, a gorgeous work of art produced out of the surplus
      revenues of a Life Insurance Company. &ldquo;Let's see,&rdquo; he calculated. &ldquo;This
      week? Three days will take us in. We are still all right. We have five.
      That gives us two days clear for this job. I feel like making this try,
      Mandy,&rdquo; he continued earnestly. &ldquo;We have this chap practically within our
      grasp. He will be off guard. The Piegans are not yet worked up to the
      point of resistance. Ten days from now our man may be we can't tell
      where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy remained silent. The ritual of her sacrifice was not yet complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are right, Allan,&rdquo; at length she said slowly with a twisted
      smile. &ldquo;I'm afraid you are right. It's hard not to be in it, though. But,&rdquo;
       she added, as if moved by a sudden thought, &ldquo;I may be in it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will certainly be with us in spirit, Mandy,&rdquo; he replied, patting the
      firm brown hand that lay upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, truly, and in our hearts,&rdquo; added the Inspector with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mandy made no reply. Already she was turning over in her mind a
      half-formed plan which she had no intention of sharing with these men,
      who, after the manner of their kind, would doubtless block it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early morning found Cameron and the Inspector on the trail toward the
      Piegan Reserve, riding easily, for they knew not what lay before them nor
      what demand they might have to make upon their horses that day. The
      Inspector rode a strongly built, stocky horse of no great speed but good
      for an all-day run. Cameron's horse was a broncho, an unlovely brute,
      awkward and ginger-colored&mdash;his name was Ginger&mdash;sad-eyed and
      wicked-looking, but short-coupled and with flat, rangy legs that promised
      speed. For his sad-eyed, awkward broncho Cameron professed a deep
      affection and defended him stoutly against the Inspector's jibes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't kill him,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;He'll go till he drops, and then
      twelve miles more. He isn't beautiful to look at and his manners are
      nothing to boast of, but he will hang upon the fence the handsome skin of
      that cob of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When still five or six miles from camp they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old boy may, of course, be gone,&rdquo; said the Inspector as he was
      parting from his friend. &ldquo;By Superintendent Strong's report he seems to be
      continually on the move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think his son will hold him for a day or two,&rdquo; replied Cameron.
      &ldquo;Now you give me a full half hour. I shall look in upon the boy, you know.
      But don't be longer. I don't as a rule linger among these Piegan gentry,
      you know, and a lengthened stay would certainly arouse suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron's way lay along the high plateau, from which a descent could be
      made by a trail leading straight south into the Piegan camp. The
      Inspector's course carried him in a long detour to the left, by which he
      should enter from the eastern end the valley in which lay the Indian camp.
      Cameron's trail at the first took him through thick timber, then, as it
      approached the level floor of the valley, through country that became more
      open. The trees were larger and with less undergrowth between them. In the
      valley itself a few stubble fields with fences sadly in need of repair
      gave evidence of the partial success of the attempts of the farm
      instructor to initiate the Piegans into the science and art of
      agriculture. A few scattering log houses, which the Indians had been
      induced by the Government to build for themselves, could be seen here and
      there among the trees. But during the long summer days, and indeed until
      driven from the open by the blizzards of winter, not one of these children
      of the free air and open sky could be persuaded to enter the dismal
      shelter afforded by the log houses. They much preferred the flimsy teepee
      or tent. And small wonder. Their methods of sanitation did not comport
      with a permanent dwelling. When the teepee grew foul, which their habits
      made inevitable, a simple and satisfactory remedy was discovered in a
      shift to another camp-ground. Not so with the log houses, whose foul
      corners, littered with the accumulated filth of a winter's occupation,
      became fertile breeding places for the germs of disease and death.
      Irregularly strewn upon the grassy plain in the valley bottom some two
      dozen teepees marked the Piegan summer headquarters. Above the camp rose
      the smoke of their camp-fires, for it was still early and their morning
      meal was yet in preparation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ILLUSIVE COPPERHEAD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Cameron's approach to the Piegan camp was greeted by a discordant chorus
      of yelps and howls from a pack of mangy, half-starved curs of all breeds,
      shapes and sizes, the invariable and inevitable concomitants of an Indian
      encampment. The squaws, who had been busy superintending the pots and pans
      in which simmered the morning meal of their lords and masters, faded from
      view at Cameron's approach, and from the teepees on every side men
      appeared and stood awaiting with stolid faces the white man's greeting.
      Cameron was known to them of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo; he cried briefly, singling out the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; replied the Chief, and awaited further parley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No grub yet, eh? You sleep too long, Chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Chief,&rdquo; continued Cameron, &ldquo;I have lost a couple of steers&mdash;big
      fellows, too&mdash;any of your fellows seen them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trotting Wolf turned to the group of Indians who had slouched toward them
      in the meantime and spoke to them in the singsong monotone of the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No see cow,&rdquo; he replied briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron threw himself from his horse and, striding to a large pot
      simmering over a fire, stuck his knife into the mass and lifted up a large
      piece of flesh, the bones of which looked uncommonly like ribs of beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this, Trotting Wolf?&rdquo; he inquired with a stern ring in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deer,&rdquo; promptly and curtly replied the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shot him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief consulted the group of Indians standing near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; he replied, indicating a young Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo; said Cameron sharply. &ldquo;I know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young Indian shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, you know English all right. What's your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the Indian shook his head, meeting Cameron's look with a fearless
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He White Cloud,&rdquo; said the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White Cloud! Big Chief, eh?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; replied Trotting Wolf, while a smile appeared on several faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shot this deer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; replied the Indian, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you could speak English all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again a smile touched the faces of some of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you shoot him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      White Cloud pointed vaguely toward the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far? Two, three, four miles?&rdquo; inquired Cameron, holding up his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the Indian, holding up five fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five miles, eh? Big deer, too,&rdquo; said Cameron, pointing to the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you carry him home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he carry him these five miles?&rdquo; continued Cameron, turning to
      Trotting Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pony,&rdquo; replied Trotting Wolf curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, turning swiftly upon the young
      Indian, &ldquo;where is the skin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian's eyes wavered for a fleeting instant. He spoke a few words to
      Trotting Wolf. Conversation followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says dogs eat him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the head? This big fellow had a big head. Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Indian's eyes wavered and again the conversation followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left him up in bush,&rdquo; replied the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will ride up and see it, then,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians became voluble among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No find,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;Wolf eat him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron raised the meat to his nose, sniffed its odor and dropped it back
      into the pot. With a single stride he was close to White Cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White Cloud,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;you speak with a forked tongue. In plain
      English, White Cloud, you lie. Trotting Wolf, you know that is no deer.
      That is cow. That is my cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trotting Wolf shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No see cow me,&rdquo; he said sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White Cloud,&rdquo; said Cameron, swiftly turning again upon the young Indian,
      &ldquo;where did you shoot my cow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young Indian stared back at Cameron, never blinking an eyelid. Cameron
      felt his wrath rising, but kept himself well in hand, remembering the
      purpose of his visit. During this conversation he had been searching the
      gathering crowd of Indians for the tall form of his friend of the previous
      night, but he was nowhere to be seen. Cameron felt he must continue the
      conversation, and, raising his voice as if in anger&mdash;and indeed there
      was no need of pretense for he longed to seize White Cloud by the throat
      and shake the truth out of him&mdash;he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf, your young men have been killing my cattle for many days.
      You know that this is a serious offense with the Police. Indians go to
      jail for this. And the Police will hold you responsible. You are the Chief
      on this reserve. The Police will ask why you cannot keep your young men
      from stealing cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The number of Indians was increasing every moment and still Cameron's eyes
      searched the group, but in vain. Murmurs arose from the Indians, which he
      easily interpreted to mean resentment, but he paid no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Police do not want a Chief,&rdquo; he cried in a still louder voice, &ldquo;who
      cannot control his young men and keep them from breaking the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused abruptly. From behind a teepee some distance away there appeared
      the figure of the &ldquo;Big Chief&rdquo; whom he so greatly desired to see. Giving no
      sign of his discovery, he continued his exhortation to Trotting Wolf, to
      that worthy's mingled rage and embarrassment. The suggestion of jail for
      cattle-thieves the Chief knew well was no empty threat, for two of his
      band even at that moment were in prison for this very crime. This
      knowledge rendered him uneasy. He had no desire himself to undergo a like
      experience, and it irked his tribe and made them restless and impatient of
      his control that their Chief could not protect them from these unhappy
      consequences of their misdeeds. They knew that with old Crowfoot, the
      Chief of the Blackfeet band, such untoward consequences rarely befell the
      members of that tribe. Already Trotting Wolf could distinguish the murmurs
      of his young men, who were resenting the charge against White Cloud, as
      well as the tone and manner in which it was delivered. Most gladly would
      he have defied this truculent rancher to do his worst, but his courage was
      not equal to the plunge, and, besides, the circumstances for such a break
      were not yet favorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Cameron, facing about, saw within a few feet of him the
      Indian whose capture he was enlisted to secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried, as if suddenly recognizing him. &ldquo;How is the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Indian with grave dignity. &ldquo;He sick here,&rdquo; touching his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Fever, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;Take me to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian led the way to the teepee that stood slightly apart from the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the teepee upon some skins and blankets lay the boy, whose bright
      eyes and flushed cheeks proclaimed fever. An old squaw, bent in form and
      wrinkled in face, crouched at the end of the couch, her eyes gleaming like
      beads of black glass in her mahogany face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the foot to-day?&rdquo; cried Allan. &ldquo;Pain bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the lad, and remained perfectly motionless but for the
      restless glittering eyes that followed every movement of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want the doctor here,&rdquo; said Cameron in a serious tone, kneeling
      beside the couch. &ldquo;That boy is in a high fever. And you can't get him too
      quick. Better send a boy to the Fort and get the Police doctor. How did
      you sleep last night?&rdquo; he inquired of the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sleep,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;Go this way&mdash;this way,&rdquo; throwing his
      arms about his head. &ldquo;Talk, talk, talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cameron was not listening to him. He was hearing a jingle of spurs and
      bridle from down the trail and he knew that the Inspector had arrived. The
      old Indian, too, had caught the sound. His piercing eyes swiftly searched
      the face of the white man beside him. But Cameron, glancing quietly at
      him, continued to discuss the condition of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must get the doctor here at once. There is danger of
      blood-poisoning. The boy may lose his foot.&rdquo; And he continued to describe
      the gruesome possibilities of neglect of that lacerated wound. As he rose
      from the couch the boy caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You' squaw good. Come see me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good&mdash;good.&rdquo; The eager look
      in the fevered eye touched Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, boy, I shall tell her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; He took the boy's
      hand in his. But the boy held it fast in a nervous grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You' squaw come&mdash;sure. Hurt here&mdash;bad.&rdquo; He struck his forehead
      with his hand. &ldquo;You' squaw come&mdash;make good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;I shall bring her myself. Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they passed out of the teepee, Cameron keeping close to the
      Indian's side and talking to him loudly and earnestly about the boy's
      condition, all the while listening to the Inspector's voice from behind
      the row of teepees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud as they came in sight of the Inspector mounted on
      his horse. &ldquo;Here is my friend, Inspector Dickson. Hello, Inspector!&rdquo; he
      called out. &ldquo;Come over here. We have a sick boy and I want you to help
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Cameron!&rdquo; cried the Inspector, riding up and dismounting. &ldquo;What's
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trotting Wolf and the other Indians slowly drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a sick boy in here,&rdquo; said Cameron, pointing to the teepee behind
      him. &ldquo;He is the son of this man, Chief&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I don't know
      your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without an instant's hesitation the Indian replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chief Onawata.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His boy got his foot in a trap. My wife dressed the wound last night,&rdquo;
       continued Cameron. &ldquo;Come in and see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Indian put up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;My boy not like strange man. Bad head&mdash;here.
      Want sleep&mdash;sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;Quite right. Let him sleep. Nothing better than
      sleep. A good long sleep will fix him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs the doctor, however,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, yes. Well, we shall send the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything all right, Inspector?&rdquo; said Cameron, throwing his friend a
      significant glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; replied the Inspector. &ldquo;But I must be going. Good-by,
      Chief!&rdquo; As his one hand closed on the Indian's his other slid down upon
      his wrist. &ldquo;I want you, Chief,&rdquo; he said in a quiet stern voice. &ldquo;I want
      you to come along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand had hardly closed upon the wrist than with a single motion,
      swift, snake-like, the Indian wrenched his hand from the Inspector's iron
      grasp and, leaping back a space of three paces, stood with body poised as
      if to spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt there, Chief! Don't move or you die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian turned to see Cameron covering him with two guns. At once he
      relaxed his tense attitude and, drawing himself up, he demanded in a voice
      of indignant scorn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you touch me? Me Big Chief! You little dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he stood, erect, tall, scornful, commanding, with his head thrown back
      and his arm outstretched, his eyes glittering and his face eloquent of
      haughty pride, he seemed the very incarnation of the wild unconquered
      spirit of that once proud race he represented. For a moment or two a deep
      silence held the group of Indians, and even the white men were impressed.
      Then the Inspector spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want this man. He is a horse-thief. I know
      him. I am going to take him to the Fort. He is a bad man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Trotting Wolf, in a loud voice, &ldquo;he no bad man. He my friend.
      Come here many days.&rdquo; He held up both hands. &ldquo;No teef&mdash;my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud murmur rose from the Indians, who in larger numbers kept crowding
      nearer. At this ominous sound the Inspector swiftly drew two revolvers,
      and, backing toward the man he was seeking to arrest, said in a quiet,
      clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf, this man goes with me. If he is no thief he will be back
      again very soon. See these guns? Six men die,&rdquo; shaking one of them, &ldquo;when
      this goes off. And six more die,&rdquo; shaking the other, &ldquo;when this goes off.
      The first man will be you, Trotting Wolf, and this man second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trotting Wolf hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;See these guns? Twelve men die if you make
      any fuss. You steal my cattle. You cannot stop your young men. The Piegans
      need a new Chief. If this man is no thief he will be back again in a few
      days. The Inspector speaks truth. You know he never lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Trotting Wolf stood irresolute. The Indians began to shuffle and
      crowd nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf,&rdquo; said the Inspector sharply, &ldquo;tell your men that the first
      man that steps beyond that poplar-tree dies. That is my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief spoke to the crowd. There was a hoarse guttural murmur in
      response, but those nearest to the tree backed away from it. They knew the
      Police never showed a gun except when prepared to use it. For years they
      had been accustomed to the administration of justice and the enforcement
      of law at the hands of the North West Mounted Police, and among the
      traditions of that Force the Indians had learned to accept two as
      absolutely settled: the first, that they never failed to get the man they
      wanted; the second, that their administration of law was marked by the
      most rigid justice. It was Chief Onawata himself that found the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me no thief. Me no steal horse. Me Big Chief. Me go to your Fort. My
      heart clean. Me see your Big Chief.&rdquo; He uttered these words with an air of
      quiet but impressive dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's sensible,&rdquo; said the Inspector, moving toward him. &ldquo;You will get
      full justice. Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go see my boy. My boy sick.&rdquo; His voice became low, soft, almost
      tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Go in and see the lad. And we will see that
      you get fair play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Indian, and, turning on his heel, he passed into the
      teepee where his boy lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the teepee wall their voices could be heard in quiet conversation.
      In a few minutes the old squaw passed out on an errand and then in again,
      eying the Inspector as she passed with malevolent hate. Again she passed
      out, this time bowed down under a load of blankets and articles of Indian
      household furniture, and returned no more. Still the conversation within
      the teepee continued, the boy's voice now and again rising high, clear,
      the other replying in low, even, deep tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will just get my horse, Inspector,&rdquo; said Cameron, making his way
      through the group of Indians to where Ginger was standing with sad and
      drooping head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time's up, I should say,&rdquo; said the Inspector to Cameron as he returned
      with his horse. &ldquo;Just give him a call, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron stepped to the door of the teepee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Chief, we must be going,&rdquo; he said, putting his head inside
      the teepee door. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Where the deuce&mdash;where is he
      gone?&rdquo; He sprang quickly out of the teepee. &ldquo;Has he passed out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passed out?&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;No. Is he not inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men rushed into the teepee. On the couch the boy still lay, his eyes
      brilliant with fever but more with hate. At the foot of the couch still
      crouched the old crone, but there was no sign of the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; said the Inspector to the old squaw, turning the blankets and
      skins upside down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hee! hee!&rdquo; she laughed in diabolical glee, spitting at him as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did no one enter?&rdquo; asked Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one except the old squaw here. I saw her go out with a pack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a pack!&rdquo; echoed Cameron. And the two men stood looking at each
      other. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Cameron in deep disgust, &ldquo;We're done. He is rightly
      named Copperhead. Quick!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Let us search this camp, though it's
      not much use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so indeed it proved. Through every teepee they searched in hot haste,
      tumbling out squalling squaws and papooses. But all in vain. Copperhead
      had as completely disappeared as if he had vanished into thin air. With
      faces stolid and unmoved by a single gleam of satisfaction the Indians
      watched their hurried search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take a turn around this camp,&rdquo; said Cameron, swinging on to his
      pony. &ldquo;You hear me!&rdquo; he continued, riding up close to Trotting Wolf, &ldquo;We
      haven't got our man but we will come back again. And listen carefully! If
      I lose a single steer this fall I shall come and take you, Trotting Wolf,
      to the Fort, if I have to bring you by the hair of the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Trotting Wolf only shrugged his shoulders, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No see cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any use taking a look around this camp?&rdquo; said the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;We might as well. There is a faint
      chance we might come across a trace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no trace did they find, though they spent an hour and more in close
      and minute scrutiny of the ground about the camp and the trails leading
      out from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where now?&rdquo; inquired the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home for me,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;To-morrow to Calgary. Next week I take up
      this trail. You may as well come along with me, Inspector. We can talk
      things over as we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were a silent and chagrined pair as they rode out from the Reserve
      toward the ranch. As they were climbing from the valley to the plateau
      above they came to a soft bit of ground. Here Cameron suddenly drew rein
      with a warning cry, and, flinging himself off his broncho, was upon his
      knee examining a fresh track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pony-track, by all that's holy! And within an hour. It is our man,&rdquo; he
      cried, examining the trail carefully and following it up the hill and out
      on to the plateau. &ldquo;It is our man sure enough, and he is taking this
      trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some miles the pony-tracks were visible enough. There was no attempt
      to cover them. The rider was evidently pushing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you think he is heading for, Inspector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Inspector, &ldquo;this trail strikes toward the Blackfoot
      Reserve by way of your ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ranch!&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;My God! Look there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the ginger-colored broncho leaped into a gallop. Five miles
      away a thin column of smoke could be seen rising up into the air. Every
      mile made it clearer to Cameron that the smoke rising from behind the
      round-topped hill before him was from his ranch-buildings, and every mile
      intensified his anxiety. His wife was alone on the ranch at the mercy of
      that fiend. That was the agonizing thought that tore at his heart as his
      panting broncho pounded along the trail. From the top of the hill
      overlooking the ranch a mile away his eye swept the scene below, swiftly
      taking in the details. The ranch-house was in flames and burning fiercely.
      The stables were untouched. A horse stood tied to the corral and two
      figures were hurrying to and fro about the blazing building. As they
      neared the scene it became clear that one of the figures was that of a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mandy!&rdquo; he shouted from afar. &ldquo;Mandy, thank God it's you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they were too absorbed in their business of fighting the fire. They
      neither heard nor saw him till he flung himself off his broncho at their
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank God, Mandy!&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;you are safe.&rdquo; He gathered her into
      his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allan, I am so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry? Sorry? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our beautiful house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all our beautiful things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things!&rdquo; He laughed aloud. &ldquo;House and things! Why, Mandy, I have YOU
      safe. What else matters?&rdquo; Again he laughed aloud, holding her off from him
      at arm's length and gazing at her grimy face. &ldquo;Mandy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe
      you are improving every day in your appearance, but you never looked so
      stunning as this blessed minute.&rdquo; Again he laughed aloud. He was white and
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the house, Allan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, by the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the house. And who's the Johnny carrying
      water there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I quite forgot. That's Thatcher's new man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather wobbly about the knees, isn't he?&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;By Jove, Mandy!
      I feared I should never see you again,&rdquo; he said in a voice that trembled
      and broke. &ldquo;And what's the chap's name?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith, I think,&rdquo; said Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith? Fine fellow! Most useful name!&rdquo; cried Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Allan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter? Nothing now, Mandy. Nothing matters. I was afraid that&mdash;but
      no matter. Hello, here's the Inspector!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; cried the Inspector, taking both her hands in his,
      &ldquo;I'm awfully glad there's nothing wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong? Look at that house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, awfully sorry. But we were afraid&mdash;of that&mdash;eh&mdash;that
      is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mandy,&rdquo; said her husband, making visible efforts to control his
      voice, &ldquo;we frankly were afraid that that old devil Copperhead had come
      this way and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did!&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. Oh, Allan, I was going to tell you just as the Inspector came,
      and I am so sorry. When you left I wanted to help. I was afraid of what
      all those Indians might do to you, so I thought I would ride up the trail
      a bit. I got near to where it branches off toward the Reserve near by
      those pine trees. There I saw a man come tearing along on a pony. It was
      this Indian. I drew aside. He was just going past when he glanced at me.
      He stopped and came rushing at me, waving a pistol in his hand. Oh, such a
      face! I wonder I ever thought him fine-looking. He caught me by the arm. I
      thought his fingers would break the bone. Look!&rdquo; She pulled up her sleeve,
      and upon the firm brown flesh blue and red finger marks could be seen. &ldquo;He
      caught me and shook me and fairly yelled at me, 'You save my boy once. Me
      save you to-day. Next time me see your man me kill him.' He flung me away
      from him and nearly off my horse&mdash;such eyes! such a face!&mdash;and
      went galloping off down the trail. I feared I was going to be ill, so I
      came on homeward. When I reached the top of the hill I saw the smoke and
      by the time I arrived the house was blazing and Smith was carrying water
      to put out the fire where it had caught upon the smoke house and stables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men listened to her story with tense white faces. When she had
      finished Cameron said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mandy, roll me up some grub in a blanket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Allan?&rdquo; her face pale as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going? To get my hands on that Indian's throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now,&rdquo; he said, moving toward his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about me, Allan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word arrested him as if a hand had gripped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said in a dazed manner. &ldquo;Why, Mandy, of course, there's you. He
      might have killed you.&rdquo; Then, shaking his shoulders as if throwing off a
      load, he said impatiently, &ldquo;Oh, I am a fool. That devil has sent me off my
      head. I tell you what, Mandy, we will feed first, then we will make new
      plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is Moira, too,&rdquo; said Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is Moira. We will plan for her too. After all,&rdquo; he continued,
      with a slight laugh and with slow deliberation, &ldquo;there's&mdash;lots&mdash;of
      time&mdash;to&mdash;get him!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SARCEE CAMP
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sun had reached the peaks of the Rockies far in the west, touching
      their white with red, and all the lesser peaks and all the rounded hills
      between with great splashes of gold and blue and purple. It is the sunset
      and the sunrise that make the foothill country a world of mystery and of
      beauty, a world to dream about and long for in later days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this mystic world of gold and blue and purple drove Cameron and
      his wife, on their way to the little town of Calgary, three days after the
      ruthless burning of their home. As the sun dipped behind the western peaks
      they reached the crossing of the Elbow and entered the wide Bow Valley,
      upon whose level plain was situated the busy, ambitious and would-be
      wicked little pioneer town. The town and plain lay bathed in a soft haze
      of rosy purple that lent a kind of Oriental splendor to the tawdry,
      unsightly cluster of shacks that sprawled here and there in irregular
      bunches on the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a picture it makes!&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;How wonderful this great plain
      with its encircling rivers, those hills with the great peaks beyond! What
      a site for a town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no finer,&rdquo; replied her husband, &ldquo;anywhere in the world that I
      know, unless it be that of 'Auld Reekie.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning!&rdquo; he echoed indignantly. &ldquo;What else but the finest of all the
      capitals of Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London?&rdquo; inquired Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London!&rdquo; echoed her husband contemptuously. &ldquo;You ignorant Colonial!
      Edinburgh, of course. But this is perfectly splendid,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I
      never get used to the wonder of Calgary. You see that deep cut between
      those peaks in the far west? That is where 'The Gap' lies, through which
      the Bow flows toward us. A great site this for a great town some day. But
      you ought to see these peaks in the morning with the sunlight coming up
      from the east across the foothills and falling upon them. Whoa, there!
      Steady, Pepper!&rdquo; he cried to the broncho, which owed its name to the
      speckled appearance of its hide, and which at the present moment was
      plunging and kicking at a dog that had rushed out from an Indian
      encampment close by the trail. &ldquo;Did you never see an Indian dog before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allan,&rdquo; cried Mandy with a shudder, &ldquo;do you know I can't bear to look
      at an Indian since last week, and I used to like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly fair, though, to blame the whole race for the deviltry of one
      specimen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a Sarcee camp, I fancy. They are a cunning lot and not the most
      reliable of the Indians. Let me see&mdash;three&mdash;four teepees. Ought
      to be fifteen or twenty in that camp. Only squaws about. The braves
      apparently are in town painting things up a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of a mile past the Indian encampment the trail made a sharp turn
      into what appeared to be the beginning of the main street of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;Here they come. Sit tight, Mandy.&rdquo; He pointed
      with his whip down the trail to what seemed to be a rolling cloud of dust,
      vocal with wild whoops and animated with plunging figures of men and
      ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, there, boys! Get on!&rdquo; cried Cameron to his plunging, jibing
      bronchos, who were evidently unwilling to face that rolling cloud of dust
      with its mass of shrieking men and galloping ponies thundering down upon
      them. Swift and fierce upon their flanks fell the hissing lash. &ldquo;Stand up
      to them, you beggars!&rdquo; he shouted to his bronchos, which seemed intent
      upon turning tail and joining the approaching cavalcade. &ldquo;Hie, there!
      Hello! Look out!&rdquo; he yelled, standing up in his wagon, waving his whip and
      holding his bronchos steadily on the trail. The next moment the dust cloud
      enveloped them and the thundering cavalcade, parting, surged by on either
      side. Cameron was wild with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infernal cheeky brutes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;For two shillings I'd go back and
      break some of their necks. Ride me down, would they?&rdquo; he continued,
      grinding his teeth in fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled up his bronchos with half a mind to turn them about and pursue
      the flying Indians. His experience and training with the Mounted Police
      made it difficult for him to accept with equal mind what he called the
      infernal cheek of a bunch of Indians. At the entreaties of his wife,
      however, he hesitated in carrying his purpose into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;They didn't hurt us, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't? No thanks to them. They might have killed you. Well, I shall see
      about this later.&rdquo; He gave his excited bronchos their head and sailed into
      town, drawing up in magnificent style at the Royal Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attendant in cowboy garb came lounging up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Billy!&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;Still blooming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! And rosebuds ain't in it with you, Colonel.&rdquo; Billy was from the
      land of colonels. &ldquo;You've got a whole garden with you this trip, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, Billy,&rdquo; replied Cameron, presenting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy pulled off his Stetson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud to meet you, madam. Hope I see you well and happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, well and happy,&rdquo; cried Mandy emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing, if looks mean anything,&rdquo; said Billy, admiration glowing in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the horses, Billy. They have come a hundred and fifty miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundred and fifty, eh? They don't look it. But I'll take care of 'em all
      right. You go right in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back presently, Billy,&rdquo; said Cameron, passing into the dingy
      sitting-room that opened off the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he had his wife settled in a frowsy little eight-by-ten
      bedroom, the best the hotel afforded, and departed to attend to his team,
      make arrangements for supper and inquire about the incoming train. The
      train he found to be three hours late. His team he found in the capable
      hands of Billy, who was unharnessing and rubbing them down. While ordering
      his supper a hand gripped his shoulder and a voice shouted in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old sport! How goes it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martin, old boy!&rdquo; shouted Cameron in reply. &ldquo;It's awfully good to see
      you. How did you get here? Oh, yes, of course, I remember. You left the
      construction camp and came here to settle down.&rdquo; All the while Cameron was
      speaking he was shaking his friend's hand with both of his. &ldquo;By Jove, but
      you're fit!&rdquo; he continued, running his eye over the slight but athletic
      figure of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit! Never fitter, not even in the old days when I used to pass the
      pigskin to you out of the scrimmage. But you? You're hardly up to the
      mark.&rdquo; The keen gray eyes searched Cameron's face. &ldquo;What's up with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. A little extra work and a little worry, but I'll tell you
      later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you on to now?&rdquo; inquired Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordering our supper. We've just come in from a hundred and fifty miles'
      drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper? Your wife here too? Glory! It's up to me, old boy! Look here,
      Connolly,&rdquo; he turned to the proprietor behind the bar, &ldquo;a bang-up supper
      for three. All the season's delicacies and all the courses in order. As
      you love me, Connolly, do us your prettiest. And soon, awfully soon. A
      hundred and fifty miles, remember. Now, then, how's my old nurse?&rdquo; he
      continued, turning back to Cameron. &ldquo;She was my nurse, remember, till you
      came and stole her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was, eh? Ask her,&rdquo; laughed Cameron. &ldquo;But she will be glad to see you.
      Where's MY nurse, then, my little nurse, who saw me through a fever and a
      broken leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's up in the mountains still, in the construction camp. I proposed
      to bring her down here with me, but there was a riot. I barely escaped. If
      ever she gets out from that camp it will be when they are all asleep or
      when she is in a box car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;I have much to tell you, and my wife
      will be glad to see you. My sister comes in by No. 1, do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister? By No. 1? You don't say! Why, I never thought your sister&mdash;by
      No. 1, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by No. 1.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Doc,&rdquo; said the hotel man, breaking into the conversation. &ldquo;There's a
      bunch of 'em comin' in, ain't there? Who's the lady you was expectin'
      yourself on No. 1?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady?&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;What's this, Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Wake up, Connolly, you're walking in your sleep,&rdquo; violently signaling
      to the hotel man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won't do, Martin,&rdquo; said Cameron with grave concern. &ldquo;You may as
      well own up. Who is it? Come. By Jove! What? A blush? And on that asbestos
      cheek? Something here, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot, Cameron! Connolly is a well-known somnambulist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; said Connolly. &ldquo;Is it catchin,' for I guess you had the same
      thing last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connolly, you've gone batty! You need a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nurse? Maybe so. Maybe so. But I guess you've got to the point where
      you need a preacher. Ha! ha! Got you that time, Doc!&rdquo; laughed the hotel
      man, winking at Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let it out, Martin. You'll feel better afterward. Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cameron, so help me! Connolly is an infernal ass. He's batty, I tell you.
      I'm treating him for it right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;never mind. I shall run up and tell my wife
      you are here. Wait for me,&rdquo; he cried, as he ran up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connolly, you fool! I'll knock your wooden block off!&rdquo; said the doctor in
      a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Doc, you did say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, confound you! Shut up! It was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you shut up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain, sure I'll shut up. But you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; broke in the doctor impatiently. &ldquo;He'll be down in a minute.
      I don't want him to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, Doc, cut it out! He ain't no Lady Clara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connolly, close that trap of yours and listen to me. This is serious.
      He'll be back in a jiffy. It's the same lady as he is going to meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same lady? But she's his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, you idiot! She's his sister. And now you've queered me
      with him and he will think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, Doc, let me be. I'll straighten that tangle out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h! Here he is. Not a word, on your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, get out!&rdquo; replied Connolly with generous enthusiasm. &ldquo;I don't leave
      no pard of mine in a hole. Say,&rdquo; he cried, turning to Cameron, &ldquo;about that
      lady. Ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your ugly mug!&rdquo; said the doctor savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the same lady. Ha! ha! Good joke, eh, Sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same lady?&rdquo; echoed Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, same lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean, Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man's drunk, Cameron. He got a permit last week and he hasn't been
      sober for a day since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Connolly again. &ldquo;Wish I had a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lady?&rdquo; said Cameron, looking at his friend suspiciously. &ldquo;And
      these blushes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, hang it!&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;I suppose I might as well tell you. I
      found out that your sister was to be in on this train, and in case you
      should not turn up I told Connolly here to have a room ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cameron, with his eyes upon his friend's face. &ldquo;You found out?
      And how did you find out that Moira was coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Martin, his face growing hotter with every word of
      explanation, &ldquo;you have a wife and we have a mutual friend in our little
      nurse, and that's how I learned. And so I thought I'd be on hand anyway.
      You remember I met your sister up at your Highland home with the
      unpronounceable name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! Cuagh Oir. Dear old spot!&rdquo; said Cameron reminiscently. &ldquo;Moira
      will be heart broken every day when she sees the Big Horn Ranch, I'm
      afraid. But here comes Mandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meeting between the doctor and Cameron's wife was like that between
      old comrades in arms, as indeed they had been through many a hard fight
      with disease, accident and death during the construction days along the
      line of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Rocky Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A jolly hour they had together at supper, exchanging news and retailing
      the latest jokes. And then Cameron told his friend the story of old
      Copperhead and of the task laid upon him by Superintendent Strong. Martin
      listened in grave silence till the tale was done, then said with quiet
      gravity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cameron, this is a serious business. Why! It's&mdash;it's terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mandy quickly, &ldquo;but you can see that he must do it. We have
      quite settled that. You see there are the women and children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there no one else? Surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there is no one else quite so fit to do it,&rdquo; said Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, you're a wonder!&rdquo; cried Martin, his face lighting up with sudden
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much of a wonder,&rdquo; she replied, a quick tremor in her voice. &ldquo;Not
      much of a wonder, I'm afraid. But how could I keep him? I couldn't keep
      him, could I,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if his country needs him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor glanced at her face with its appealing deep blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Jove! You couldn't keep him, not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mandy,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;you must upstairs and to bed.&rdquo; He read aright
      the signs upon her face. &ldquo;You are tired and you will need all the sleep
      you can get. Wait for me, Martin, I'll be down in a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached their room Cameron turned and took his wife in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mandy! as Martin says, you are wonderful. You are a brave woman. You have
      nerve enough for both of us, and you will need to have nerve for both, for
      how I am going to leave you I know not. But now you must to bed. I have a
      little business to attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business?&rdquo; inquired his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, I won't try to hide it from you, Mandy. It's 'The Big Business.'
      We are&mdash;Dr. Martin and I&mdash;going up to the Barracks.
      Superintendent Strong has come down for a consultation.&rdquo; He paused and
      looked into his wife's face. &ldquo;I must go, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, Allan. You must go. But&mdash;do you know&mdash;it's
      foolish to say it, but as those Indians passed us I fancied I saw the face
      of Copperhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, I fancy,&rdquo; said her husband with a laugh. &ldquo;He'd know better than
      run into this town in open day just now. All Indians will look to you like
      old Copperhead for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so. I fancy I'm a little nervous. But come back soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure of that, sweetheart. Meantime sleep well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little town of Calgary stands on one of the most beautiful town-sites
      in all the world. A great plain with ramparts of hills on every side,
      encircled by the twin mountain rivers, the Bow and the Elbow, overlooked
      by rolling hills and far away to the west by the mighty peaks of the
      Rockies, it holds at once ample space and unusual picturesque beauty. The
      little town itself was just emerging from its early days as a railway
      construction-camp and was beginning to develop ambitions toward a
      well-ordered business activity and social stability. It was an all-night
      town, for the simple and sufficient reason that its communications with
      the world lying to the east and to the west began with the arrival of No.
      2 at half-past twelve at night and No. 1 at five o'clock next morning. Few
      of its citizens thought it worth while to settle down for the night until
      after the departure of No. 2 on its westward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this &ldquo;all-night&rdquo; little town Cameron and the doctor took their
      way. The sidewalks were still thronged, the stores still doing business,
      the restaurants, hotels, pool-rooms all wide open. It kept Sergeant Crisp
      busy enough running out the &ldquo;tin-horn&rdquo; gamblers and whisky-peddlers,
      keeping guard over the fresh and innocent lambs that strayed in from the
      East and across from the old land ready for shearing, and preserving law
      and order in this hustling frontier town. Money was still easy in the
      town, and had Sergeant Crisp been minded for the mere closing of his eyes
      or turning of his back upon occasion he might have retired early from the
      Force with a competency. Unhappily for Sergeant Crisp, however, there
      stood in the pathway of his fortune the awkward fact of his conscience and
      his oath of service. Consequently he was forced to grub along upon the
      munificent bounty of the daily pay with which Her Majesty awarded the
      faithful service of the non-coms. in her North West Mounted Police Force.
      And indeed through all the wide reaches of that great West land during
      those pioneer days and among all the officers of that gallant force no
      record can be found of an officer who counted fortune dearer than honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this wide awake, wicked, but well-watched little town Cameron with
      his friend made his way westward toward the Barracks to keep his
      appointment with his former Chief, Superintendent Strong. The Barracks
      stood upon the prairie about half a mile distant from the town. They found
      Superintendent Strong fuming with impatience, which he controlled with
      difficulty while Cameron presented his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cameron, you've come at last,&rdquo; was his salutation when the
      introduction was completed. &ldquo;When did you get into town? I have been
      waiting all day to see you. Where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrived an hour ago,&rdquo; said Cameron shortly, for he did not half like the
      Superintendent's brusque manner. &ldquo;The trail was heavy owing to the rain
      day before yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you leave the ranch?&rdquo; inquired Sergeant Crisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday morning,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;The colts were green and I couldn't
      send them along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday morning!&rdquo; exclaimed Sergeant Crisp. &ldquo;You needn't apologize for
      the colts, Cameron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't apologizing for anybody or anything. I was making a statement of
      fact,&rdquo; replied Cameron curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, very good going, Cameron. Very good going, indeed, I should
      say,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, conscious of his own brusqueness and
      anxious to appease. &ldquo;Did Mrs. Cameron come with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed. That is a long drive for a lady to make, Cameron. Too long a
      drive, I should say. I hope she is quite well, not&mdash;eh&mdash;over-fatigued?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is quite well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she is an old campaigner,&rdquo; said the Superintendent with a smile,
      &ldquo;and not easily knocked up if I remember her aright. But I ought to say,
      Cameron, how very deeply I appreciate your very fine&mdash;indeed very
      handsome conduct in volunteering to come to our assistance in this matter.
      Very handsome indeed I call it. It will have a good effect upon the
      community. I appreciate the sacrifice. The Commissioner and the whole
      Force will appreciate it. But,&rdquo; he added, as if to himself, &ldquo;before we are
      through with this business I fear there will be more sacrifice demanded
      from all of us. I trust none of us will be found wanting.&rdquo; The
      Superintendent's voice was unduly solemn, his manner almost somber.
      Cameron was impressed with this manifestation of feeling so unusual with
      the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more news, sir?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, every post brings news of seditious meetings up north along the
      Saskatchewan and of indifference on the part of the Government. And
      further, I have the most conclusive evidence that our Indians are being
      tampered with, and successfully too. There is no reason to doubt that the
      head chiefs have been approached and that many of the minor chiefs are
      listening to the proposals of Riel and his half-breeds. But you have some
      news to give, I understand? Dickson said you would give me particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Cameron briefly related the incidents in connection with the
      attempted arrest of the Sioux Chief, and closed with a brief account of
      the burning of his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is most daring, most serious,&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent. &ldquo;But
      you are quite certain that it was the Sioux that was responsible for the
      outrage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;he met my wife on a trail five miles away,
      threatened her, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Cameron! Threatened your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, nearly flung her off her horse,&rdquo; replied Cameron, his voice quiet
      and even, but his eyes glowing like fires in his white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flung her off her horse? But&mdash;he didn't injure her?&rdquo; replied the
      Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he terrified her with his threats and then went on toward the
      house, which he left in flames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Cameron!&rdquo; said the Superintendent, rising in his excitement.
      &ldquo;This is really terrible. You must have suffered awful anxiety. I
      apologize for my abrupt manner a moment ago,&rdquo; he added, offering his hand.
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, Superintendent,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;I'm afraid I am a
      little upset myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a God's mercy she escaped! How came that, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Cameron told the story of the rescue of the Indian boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That undoubtedly explains it,&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent. &ldquo;That was a
      most fortunate affair. Do an Indian a good turn and he will never forget
      it. I shudder to think of what might have happened, for I assure you that
      this Copperhead will stick at nothing. We have an unusually able man to
      deal with, and we shall put our whole Force on this business of arresting
      this man. Have you any suggestions yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;except that it would appear to be a mistake to give
      any sign that we were very specially anxious to get him just now. So far
      we have not shown our hand. Any concentrating of the Force upon his
      capture would only arouse suspicion and defeat our aim, while my going
      after him, no matter how keenly, will be accounted for on personal
      grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in that, but do you think you can get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to get him,&rdquo; said Cameron quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superintendent glanced at his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, I believe you will! But remember, you can count on me and on my
      Force to a man any time and every time to back you up, and there's my hand
      on it. And now, let's get at this thing. We have a cunning devil to do
      with and he has gathered about him the very worst elements on the
      reserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they sat and made their plans till far on into the night. But as
      a matter of fact they could make little progress. They knew well it would
      be extremely difficult to discover their man. Owing to the state of
      feeling throughout the reserves the source of information upon which the
      Police ordinarily relied had suddenly dried up or become untrustworthy. A
      marked change had come over the temper of the Indians. While as yet they
      were apparently on friendly terms and guilty of no open breach of the law,
      a sullen and suspicious aloofness marked the bearing of the younger braves
      and even of some of the chiefs toward the Police. Then, too, among the
      Piegans in the south and among the Sarcees whose reserve was in the
      neighborhood of Calgary an epidemic of cattle-stealing had broken out and
      the Police were finding it increasingly difficult to bring the criminals
      to justice. Hence with this large increase in crime and with the changed
      attitude and temper of the Indians toward the Police, such an amount of
      additional patrol-work was necessary that the Police had almost reached
      the limit of their endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, we have really a difficult proposition before us, short-handed
      as we are,&rdquo; said the Superintendent as they closed their interview.
      &ldquo;Indeed, if things become much worse we may find it necessary to organize
      the settlers as Home Guards. An outbreak on the Saskatchewan might produce
      at any moment the most serious results here and in British Columbia.
      Meantime, while we stand ready to help all we can, it looks to me,
      Cameron, that you are right and that in this business you must go it alone
      pretty much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I realize that, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;But first I must get my house
      built and things in shape, then I hope to take this up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent. &ldquo;Take a month. He can't do
      much more harm in a month, and meantime we shall do our utmost to obtain
      information and we shall keep you informed of anything we discover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent and Sergeant accompanied Cameron and his friend to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a black night,&rdquo; said Sergeant Crisp. &ldquo;I hope they're not running
      any 'wet freight' in to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good night for it, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Dr. Martin. &ldquo;Do you expect
      anything to come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard rumors,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, &ldquo;and there is a freight train
      standing right there now which I have already gone through but upon which
      it is worth while still to keep an eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, shaking Cameron by the hand.
      &ldquo;Keep me posted and when within reach be sure and see me. Good-night, Dr.
      Martin. We may want you too before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir, you have only to say the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night was so black that the trail which in the daylight was worn
      smooth and plainly visible was quite blotted out. The light from the
      Indian camp fire, which was blazing brightly a hundred yards away, helped
      them to keep their general direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a proper black night commend me to the prairie,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It
      is the dead level does it, I believe. There is nothing to cast a
      reflection or a shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better in a few minutes,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;when we get our night
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are off the trail a bit, I think,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I am hitting toward the fire. The light makes it better
      going that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, that chap appears to be going some. Quite a song and dance he's
      giving them,&rdquo; said the doctor, pointing to an Indian who in the full light
      of the camp fire was standing erect and, with hand outstretched, was
      declaiming to the others, who, kneeling or squatting about the fire, were
      giving him rapt attention. The erect figure and outstretched arm arrested
      Cameron. A haunting sense of familiarity floated across his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go nearer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With extreme caution they made about two-thirds of the distance when a
      howl from an Indian dog revealed their presence. At once the speaker who
      had been standing in the firelight sank crouching to the ground. Instantly
      Cameron ran forward a few swift steps and, like a hound upon a deer, leapt
      across the fire and fair upon the crouching Indian, crying &ldquo;Call the
      Police, Martin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a loud cry of &ldquo;Police! Police! Help here!&rdquo; Martin sprang into the
      middle of an excited group of Indians. Two of them threw themselves upon
      him, but with a hard right and left he laid them low and, seizing a stick
      of wood, sprang toward two others who were seeking to batter the life out
      of Cameron as he lay gripping his enemy by the throat with one hand and
      with the other by the wrist to check a knife thrust. Swinging his stick
      around his head and repeating his cry for help, Martin made Cameron's
      assailants give back a space and before they could renew the attack
      Sergeant Crisp burst open the door of the Barracks, and, followed by a
      Slim young constable and the Superintendent, came rushing with shouts upon
      the scene. Immediately upon the approach of the Police the Indians ceased
      the fight and all that could faded out of the light into the black night
      around them, while the Indian who continued to struggle with incredible
      fury to free himself from Cameron's grip suddenly became limp and
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what's all this?&rdquo; demanded the Sergeant. &ldquo;Why, it's you, doctor, and
      where&mdash;? You don't mean that's Cameron there? Hello, Cameron!&rdquo; he
      said, leaning over him. &ldquo;Let go! He's safe enough. We've got him all
      right. Let go! By Jove! Are they both dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Superintendent came up. The incidents leading up to the present
      situation were briefly described by the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't get this fellow free,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, who was working hard to
      release the Indian's throat from the gripping fingers. He turned Cameron
      over on his back. He was quite insensible. Blood was pouring from his
      mouth and nose, but his fingers like steel clamps were gripping the wrist
      and throat of his foe. The Indian lay like dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, doctor! What shall we do?&rdquo; cried the Superintendent. &ldquo;Is he
      dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Martin, with his hand upon Cameron's heart. &ldquo;Bring water. You
      can't loosen his fingers till he revives. The blow that knocked him
      senseless set those fingers as they are and they will stay set thus till
      released by returning consciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here then, get water quick!&rdquo; shouted the Superintendent to the slim young
      constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually as the water was splashed upon his face Cameron came back to
      life and, relaxing his fingers, stretched himself with a sigh as of vast
      relief and lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take that, you beast!&rdquo; cried the Sergeant, dashing the rest of the
      water into the face of the Indian lying rigid and motionless on the
      ground. A long shudder ran through the Indian's limbs. Clutching at his
      throat with both hands, he raised himself to a sitting posture, his breath
      coming in raucous gasps, glared wildly upon the group, then sank back upon
      the ground, rolled over upon his side and lay twitching and breathing
      heavily, unheeded by the doctor and Police who were working hard over
      Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No bones broken, I think,&rdquo; said the doctor, feeling the battered head.
      &ldquo;Here's where the blow fell that knocked him out,&rdquo; pointing to a ridge
      that ran along the side of Cameron's head. &ldquo;A little lower, a little more
      to the front and he would never have moved. Let's get him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron opened his eyes, struggled to speak and sank back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't stir, old chap. You're all right. Don't move for a bit. Could you
      get a little brandy, Sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the slim young constable rushed toward the Barracks and in a few
      moments returned with the spirits. After taking a sip of the brandy
      Cameron again opened his eyes and managed to say &ldquo;Don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old chap,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;We won't move you yet. Just lie
      still a bit.&rdquo; But as once more Cameron opened his eyes the agony of the
      appeal in them aroused the doctor's attention. &ldquo;Something wrong, eh?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Are you in pain, old boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appealing eyes closed, then, opening again, turned toward the
      Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperhead,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; said the Superintendent kneeling down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more with painful effort Cameron managed to utter the word
      &ldquo;Copperhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperhead!&rdquo; ejaculated the Superintendent in a low tense voice,
      springing to his feet and turning toward the unconscious Indian. &ldquo;He's
      gone!&rdquo; he cried with a great oath. &ldquo;He's gone! Sergeant Crisp!&rdquo; he
      shouted, &ldquo;Call out the whole Force! Surround this camp and hold every
      Indian. Search every teepee for this fellow who was lying here. Quick!
      Quick!&rdquo; Leaving Cameron to the doctor, who in a few minutes became
      satisfied that no serious injury had been sustained, he joined in the
      search with fierce energy. The teepees were searched, the squaws and
      papooses were ruthlessly bundled out from their slumbers and with the
      Indians were huddled into the Barracks. But of the Sioux Chief there was
      no sign. He had utterly vanished. The black prairie had engulfed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Police had their own methods. Within a quarter of an hour half a
      dozen mounted constables were riding off in different directions to cover
      the main trails leading to the Indian reserves and to sweep a wide circle
      about the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will surely get him,&rdquo; said Dr. Martin confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much chance of it,&rdquo; growled Cameron, to whom with returning
      consciousness had come the bitter knowledge of the escape of the man he
      had come to regard as his mortal enemy. &ldquo;I had him fast enough,&rdquo; he
      groaned, &ldquo;in spite of the best he could do, and I would have choked his
      life out had it not been for these other devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They certainly jumped in savagely,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;In fact I cannot
      understand how they got at the thing so quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you hear him call?&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;It was his call that did it.
      Something he said turned them into devils. They were bound to do for me. I
      never saw Indians act like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard that call, and it mighty near did the trick for you. Thank
      Heaven your thick Hielan' skull saved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did they let him go?&rdquo; again groaned Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Because he was too swift for us,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, who had
      come in, &ldquo;and we too slow. I thought it was an ordinary Indian row, you
      see, but I might have known that you would not have gone in in that style
      without good reason. Who would think that this old devil should have the
      impudence to camp right here under our nose? Where did he come from
      anyway, do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been to the Blackfoot Reserve like enough and was on his way to the
      Sarcees when he fell in with this little camp of theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about it,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent gloomily. &ldquo;And to think you
      had him fast and we let him go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought brought small comfort to any of them, least of all to Cameron.
      In that vast foothill country with all the hidings of the hills and
      hollows there was little chance that the Police would round up the
      fugitive, and upon Cameron still lay the task of capturing this cunning
      and resourceful foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Martin cheerily. &ldquo;Three out, all out. You'll get him
      next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that. But I'll get him some time or he'll get me,&rdquo;
       replied Cameron as his face settled into grim lines. &ldquo;Let's get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite fit?&rdquo; inquired the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit enough. Sore a bit in the head, but can navigate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how disappointed and chagrined I feel. It isn't often
      that my wits are so slow but&mdash;&rdquo; The Superintendent's jaws here cut
      off his speech with a snap. The one crime reckoned unpardonable in the men
      under his own command was that of failure and his failure to capture old
      Copperhead thus delivered into his hands galled him terribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night, Cameron,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, looking out into the
      black night. &ldquo;We shall let you know to-morrow the result of our scouting,
      though I don't expect much from it. He is much too clever to be caught in
      the open in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he'll skidoo,&rdquo; said Dr. Martin hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he's not that kind,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent. &ldquo;You can't scare him
      out. You have got to catch him or kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are right, sir,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;He will stay till his work is
      done or till he is made to quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Cameron&mdash;till he is made to quit&mdash;and that's your
      job,&rdquo; said the Superintendent solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is my job, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron simply and with equal
      solemnity. &ldquo;I shall do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have every confidence in you, Cameron,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent.
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said again, shutting the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, old man, this is too gruesome,&rdquo; said Martin with fierce impatience.
      &ldquo;I can't see why it's up to you more than any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sun Dance Trail is the trail he must take to do his work. That was my
      patrol last year&mdash;I know it best. God knows I don't want this&mdash;&rdquo;
       his breath came quick&mdash;&ldquo;I am not afraid&mdash;but&mdash;but there's&mdash;We
      have been together for such a little while, you know.&rdquo; He could get no
      farther for a moment or two, then added quietly, &ldquo;But somehow I know&mdash;yes
      and she knows&mdash;bless her brave heart&mdash;it is my job. I must stay
      with it.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GIRL ON NO. 1.
    </h3>
    <p>
      By the time they had reached the hotel Cameron was glad enough to go to
      his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not tell your wife, I suppose,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her? Certainly!&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;She is with me in this. I play fair
      with her. Don't you fear, she is up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so she was, and, though her face grew white as she listened to the
      tale, never for a moment did her courage falter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, is Allan all right? Tell me,&rdquo; she said, her big blue eyes holding
      his in a steady gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right enough, but he must have a long sleep. You must not let him stir at
      five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mandy, &ldquo;I shall go to meet the train, Allan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know Moira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I shall find her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Dr. Martin in a deprecating tone, &ldquo;I know Miss Cameron,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;Why, that is splendid! You will go and
      Allan need not be disturbed. She will understand. Not a word, now, Allan.
      We will look after this, the doctor and I, eh, Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;eh&mdash;yes&mdash;yes certainly, of course. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, indeed?&rdquo; echoed Mandy briskly. &ldquo;She will understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus it was arranged. Under the influence of a powder left by Dr.
      Martin, Cameron, after an hour's tossing, fell into a heavy sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you are here,&rdquo; said Mandy to the doctor, as he looked in
      upon her. &ldquo;You are sure there is no injury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing serious. Shock, that's all. A day's quiet will fix him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so thankful,&rdquo; said Mandy, heaving a deep sigh of relief, &ldquo;and I am
      so glad that you are here. And it is so nice that you know Moira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to the train?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, there is no need, and I don't like to leave him. Besides you
      don't need me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-o-o, no, not at all&mdash;certainly not,&rdquo; said the doctor with growing
      confidence. &ldquo;Good-night. I shall show her to her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;I shall meet you when you come. Thank you so much. So
      glad you are here,&rdquo; she added with a tremulous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor passed down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, she's a brick!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;She has about all she can
      stand just now. Glad I am here, eh? Well, I guess I am too. But what about
      this thing? It's up to me now to do the Wild West welcome act, and I'm
      scared&mdash;plain scared to death. She won't know me from a goat. Let's
      see. I've got two hours yet to work up my ginger. I'll have a pipe to
      start with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed into the bar, where, finding himself alone, he curled up in a
      big leather chair and gave himself up to his pipe and his dreams. The
      dingy bar-room gave place to a little sunny glen in the Highlands of
      Scotland, in which nestled a little cluster of stone-built cottages,
      moss-grown and rose-covered. Far down in the bottom of the Glen a tiny
      loch gleamed like a jewel. Up on the hillside above the valley an avenue
      of ragged pines led to a large manor house, old, quaint, but dignified,
      and in the doorway a maiden stood, grave of face and wonderfully sweet, in
      whose brown eyes and over whose brown curls all the glory of the little
      Glen of the Cup of Gold seemed to gather. Through many pipes he pursued
      his dreams, but always they led him to that old doorway and the maiden
      with the grave sweet face and the hair and eyes full of the golden
      sunlight of the Glen Cuagh Oir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; he grumbled to himself at last, knocking the ashes from his
      pipe. &ldquo;She has forgotten me. It was only one single day. But what a day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit a fresh pipe and began anew to dream of that wonderful day, that
      day which was the one unfading point of light in all his Old Country stay.
      Not even the day when he stood to receive his parchment and the special
      commendation of the Senatus and of his own professor for his excellent
      work lived with him like that day in the Glen. Every detail of the picture
      he could recall and ever in the foreground the maiden. With deliberate
      purpose he settled himself in his chair and set himself to fill in those
      fine and delicate touches that were necessary to make perfect the
      foreground of his picture, the pale olive face with its bewildering frame
      of golden waves and curls, the clear brown eyes, now soft and tender, now
      flashing with wrath, and the voice with its soft Highland cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, I'm dotty! Clean dotty! I'll make an ass of myself, sure thing,
      when I see her to-day.&rdquo; He sprang from his chair and shook himself
      together. &ldquo;Besides, she has forgotten all about me.&rdquo; He looked at his
      watch. It was twenty minutes to train-time. He opened the door and looked
      out. The chill morning air struck him sharply in the face. He turned
      quickly, snatched his overcoat from a nail in the hall and put it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Billy, who combined in his own person the offices of ostler,
      porter and clerk, appeared, his lantern shining with a dim yellow glare in
      the gray light of the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 1 is about due, Doc,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is, eh? I say, Billy,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;want to do something for
      me?&rdquo; He pushed a dollar at Billy over the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, Doc, without further insult,&rdquo; replied Billy, shoving the dollar
      back with a lordly scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Billy, you're a white little soul. Now listen. I want your
      ladies' parlor aired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aired?&rdquo; gasped Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, open the windows. Put on a fire. I have a lady coming&mdash;I have&mdash;that
      is&mdash;Sergeant Cameron's sister is coming&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; said Billy with a wink. &ldquo;I get you, Doc. But what about the
      open window, Doc? It's rather cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it up and put on a fire. Those Old Country people are mad about
      fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Doc,&rdquo; replied Billy with another knowing wink. &ldquo;The best is
      none too good for her, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, now, Billy&mdash;&rdquo; the doctor's tone grew severe&mdash;&ldquo;let's
      have no nonsense. This is Sergeant Cameron's sister. He is knocked out,
      unable to meet her. I am taking his place. Do you get me? Now be quick. If
      you have any think juice in that block of yours turn it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy twisted one ear as if turning a cock, and tapped his forehead with
      his knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;she's workin' like a watch, full jewel, patent
      lever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Now get on to this. Sitting-room aired, good fire going,
      windows open and a cup of coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee? Say, Doc, there ain't time. What about tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough, Billy, you haven't got any but that infernal green
      stuff fit to tan the stomach of a brass monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another can, Doc. I know where it is. Leave it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Billy, I trust you. They are death on tea in the Old Country.
      And toast, Billy. What about toast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toast? Toast, eh? Well, all right, Doc. Toast it is. Trust yours truly.
      You keep her out a-viewin' the scenery for half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Billy, a big pitcher of hot water. They can't live without hot water
      in the morning, those Old Country people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing, Doc. A tub if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a pitcher will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point a long drawn whistle sounded through the still morning air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she goes, Doc. She has struck the grade. Say, Doc&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his words fell upon empty space. The doctor had already disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, he's a sprinter,&rdquo; said Billy to himself. &ldquo;He ain't takin' no chances
      on bein' late. Shouldn't be surprised if the Doc got there all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted upstairs and looked around the ladies' parlor. The air was heavy
      with mingled odors of the bar and the kitchen. A spittoon occupied a
      prominent place in the center of the room. The tables were dusty, the
      furniture in confusion. The ladies' parlor was perfectly familiar to
      Billy, but this morning he viewed it with new eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, the Doc ain't fair. He's too swift in his movements,&rdquo; he muttered to
      himself as he proceeded to fling things into their places. He raised the
      windows, opened the stove door and looked in. The ashes of many fires half
      filling the box met his eyes with silent reproach. &ldquo;Say, the Doc ain't
      fair,&rdquo; he muttered again. &ldquo;Them ashes ought to have been out of there long
      ago.&rdquo; This fact none knew better than himself, inasmuch as there was no
      other from whom this duty might properly be expected. Yet it brought some
      small relief to vent his disgust upon this offending accumulation of many
      days' neglect. There was not a moment to lose. He was due in ten minutes
      to meet the possible guests for the Royal at the train. He seized a pail
      left in the hall by the none too tidy housemaid and with his hands scooped
      into it the ashes from the stove, and, leaving a cloud of dust to settle
      everywhere upon tables and chairs, ran down with his pail and back again
      with kindling and firewood and had a fire going in an extraordinarily
      short time. He then caught up an ancient antimacassar, used it as a duster
      upon chairs and tables, flung it back again in its place over the rickety
      sofa and rushed for the station to find that the train had already pulled
      in, had come to a standstill and was disgorging its passengers upon the
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roy&mdash;al Ho&mdash;tel!&rdquo; shouted Billy. &ldquo;Best in town! All the
      comforts and conveniences! Yes, sir! Take your grip, sir? Just give me
      them checks! That's all right, leave 'em to me. I'll get your baggage all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the doctor wandering distractedly up and down the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Doc, got your lady? Not on the Pullman, eh? Take a look in the
      First Class. Say, Doc,&rdquo; he added in a lower voice, coming near to the
      doctor, &ldquo;what's that behind you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned sharply and saw a young lady whose long clinging black
      dress made her seem taller than she was. She wore a little black hat with
      a single feather on one side, which gave it a sort of tam o' shanter
      effect. She came forward with hand outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you, Mr. Martin,&rdquo; she said in a voice that indicated immense
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Is it you? And to think I didn't know you. And to think
      you should remember me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember! Well do I remember you&mdash;and that day in the Cuagh Oir&mdash;but
      you have forgotten all about that day.&rdquo; A little flush appeared on her
      pale cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten?&rdquo; cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't know me,&rdquo; she added with a slight severity in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not looking for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not looking for me?&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Then who&mdash;?&rdquo; She paused in a
      sudden confusion, and with a little haughty lift of her head said, &ldquo;Where
      is Allan, my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor ignored her question. He was gazing at her in stupid
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for a little girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in a blue serge dress and
      tangled hair, brown, and all curls, with brown eyes and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found a grown up woman with all the silly curls in their proper
      place&mdash;much older&mdash;very much older. It is a habit we have in
      Scotland of growing older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Older?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, older, and more sober and sensible&mdash;and plainer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plainer?&rdquo; The doctor's mind was evidently not working with its usual ease
      and swiftness, partly from amazement at the transformation that had
      resulted in this tall slender young lady standing before him with her
      stately air, and partly from rage at himself and his unutterable
      stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not answered me,&rdquo; said the girl, obviously taken aback at
      the doctor's manner. &ldquo;Where is my brother? He was to meet me. This is Cal&mdash;gar&mdash;ry,
      is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Calgary all right,&rdquo; cried the doctor, glad to find in this fact a
      solid resting place for his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my brother? There is nothing wrong?&rdquo; The alarm in her voice brought
      him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? Not a bit. At least, not much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much? Tell me at once, please.&rdquo; With an imperious air the young lady
      lifted her head and impaled the doctor with her flashing brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor in halting confusion, &ldquo;you see, he met with an
      accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You are hiding something from me, Mr. Martin.
      My brother is ill, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not he. An Indian hit him on the head,&rdquo; said the doctor, rendered
      desperate by her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Indian?&rdquo; Her cry, her white face, the quick clutch of her hands at her
      heart, roused the doctor's professional instincts and banished his
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is perfectly all right, I assure you, Miss Cameron. Only it was better
      that he should have his sleep out. He was most anxious to meet you, but as
      his medical adviser I urged him to remain quiet and offered to come in his
      place. His wife is with him. A day's rest, believe me, will make him quite
      fit.&rdquo; The doctor's manner was briskly professional and helped to quiet the
      girl's alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see him?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, in a few hours when he wakes and when you are rested.
      Here, Billy, take Miss Cameron's checks. Look sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Doc,&rdquo; said Billy in an undertone, &ldquo;about that tea and toast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce&mdash;?&rdquo; said the doctor impatiently. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;all
      right! Only look lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep her a-viewin' the scenery, Doc, a bit,&rdquo; continued Billy under his
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, get a move on, Billy! What are you monkeying about?&rdquo; said the doctor
      quite crossly. He was anxious to escape from a position that had become
      intolerable to him. For months he had been looking forward to this meeting
      and now he had bungled it. In the first place he had begun by not knowing
      the girl who for three years and more had been in his dreams day and
      night, then he had carried himself like a schoolboy in her presence, and
      lastly had frightened her almost to death by his clumsy announcement of
      her brother's accident. The young lady at his side, with the quick
      intuition of her Celtic nature, felt his mood, and, not knowing the cause,
      became politely distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their walk to the hotel Dr. Martin pointed out the wonderful pearly
      gray light stealing across the plain and beginning to brighten on the tops
      of the rampart hills that surrounded the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see the Rockies in an hour, Miss Cameron, in the far west
      there,&rdquo; he said. But there was no enthusiasm in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, how beautiful!&rdquo; said the young lady. But her tone, too, was
      lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperately the doctor strove to make conversation during their short walk
      and with infinite relief did he welcome the appearance of Mandy at her
      bedroom door waiting their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother's wife, Miss Cameron,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a single moment they stood searching each other's souls. Then by some
      secret intuition known only to the female mind they reached a conclusion,
      an entirely satisfactory conclusion, too, for at once they were in each
      other's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Moira?&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl in an eager, tremulous voice. &ldquo;And my brother? Is he
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Of course he is&mdash;perfectly fine. He is sleeping now. We will
      not wake him. He has had none too good a night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Moira, &ldquo;don't wake him. Oh, I am so glad. You see, I was
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid? Why were you afraid?&rdquo; inquired Mandy, looking indignantly at the
      doctor, who stood back, a picture of self condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mrs. Cameron, blame me. I deserve it all. I bungled the whole
      thing this morning and frightened Miss Cameron nearly into a fit, for no
      other reason than that I am all ass. Now I shall retire. Pray deal gently
      with me. Good-by!&rdquo; he added abruptly, lifted his hat and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with him?&rdquo; said Mandy, looking at her sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, I am sure,&rdquo; replied Moira indifferently. &ldquo;Is there
      anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not like himself a bit. But come, my dear, take off your things. As
      the doctor says, a sleep for a couple of hours will do you good. After
      that you will see Allan. You are looking very weary, dear, and no wonder,
      no wonder,&rdquo; said Mandy, &ldquo;with all that journey and&mdash;and all you have
      gone through.&rdquo; She gathered the girl into her strong arms. &ldquo;My, I could
      just pick you up like a babe!&rdquo; She held her close and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caressing touch was too much for the girl. With a rush the tears came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, oh,&rdquo; she cried, lapsing into her Highland speech, &ldquo;it iss ashamed of
      myself I am, but no one has done that to me for many a day since&mdash;since&mdash;my
      father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, you poor darling,&rdquo; said Mandy, comforting her as if she
      were a child, &ldquo;you will not want for love here in this country. Cry away,
      it will do you good.&rdquo; There was a sound of feet on the stairs. &ldquo;Hush,
      hush, Billy is coming.&rdquo; She swept the girl into her bedroom as Billy
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am just silly,&rdquo; said Moira impatiently, as she wiped her eyes. &ldquo;But
      you are so good, and I will never be forgetting your kindness to me this
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot water,&rdquo; said Billy, tapping at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot water! What for?&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the young lady. The doctor said she was used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor? Well, that is very thoughtful. Do you want hot water, Moira?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the very thing I do want to get the dust out of my eyes and the
      grime off my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the tea is in the ladies' parlor,&rdquo; added Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea!&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;the very thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor said tea and toast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing! Said they were all stuck on tea in the Old Country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he did, eh? Will you have tea, Moira?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No tea, thank you. I shall lie down, I think, for a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, dear, we will see you at breakfast. Don't worry. I shall call
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she kissed the girl and left her to sleep. She found Billy standing
      in the ladies' parlor with a perplexed and disappointed look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Doc said she'd sure want some tea,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you made the tea yourself?&rdquo; inquired Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing! The Doc&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Billy, I'd just love a cup of tea if you don't mind wasting it on
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing, ma'm! The Doc won't mind, bein' as she turned it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Dr. Martin gone, Billy? He needs a cup of tea; he's been up all
      night. He must be feeling tough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judgin' by his langwidge I should surmise yes,&rdquo; said Billy judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you get him, Billy, and bring him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get him? S'pose I could. But as to bringin' him here, I'd prefer wild
      cats myself. The last I seen of him he was hikin' for the Rockies with a
      blue haze round his hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in the world is wrong with him, Billy?&rdquo; said Mandy anxiously.
      &ldquo;I've never seen him this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor me,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;The Doc's a pretty level headed cuss. There's
      somethin' workin' on him, if you ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, you get him and tell him we want to see him at breakfast, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, Billy, I want him to see my husband then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing! That'll catch him, I guess. He's dead stuck on his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it did catch him, for, after breakfast was over, clean-shaven, calm
      and controlled, and in his very best professional style, Dr. Martin made
      his morning call on his patient. Rigidly he eliminated from his manner
      anything beyond a severe professional interest. Mandy, who for two years
      had served with him as nurse, and who thought she knew his every mood, was
      much perplexed. Do what she could, she was unable to break through the
      barrier of his professional reserve. He was kindly courteous and perfectly
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would suggest a quiet day for him, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; was his verdict after
      examining the patient. &ldquo;He will be quite able to get up in the afternoon
      and go about, but not to set off on a hundred and fifty mile drive. A
      quiet day, sleep, cheerful company, such as you can furnish here, will fix
      him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, we will secure the quiet day if you will furnish the cheerful
      company,&rdquo; said Mandy, beaming on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a very busy day before me, and as for cheerful company, with you
      two ladies he will have all the company that is good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CHEERFUL company, you said, Doctor. If you desert us how can we be
      cheerful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly for that reason,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Martin,&rdquo; interposed Cameron, &ldquo;take them out for a drive this
      afternoon and leave me in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drive!&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;with one hundred and fifty miles behind me and
      another hundred and fifty miles before me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ride then,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Moira, you used to be fond of riding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am still,&rdquo; cried the girl, with sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ride!&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;Great! This is the country for riding. But have
      you a habit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My habit is in one of my boxes,&rdquo; replied Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can get a habit,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and two of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's settled, then,&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;I am not very keen. We shall do some
      shopping, Allan, you and I this afternoon and you two can go off to the
      hills. The hills! th&mdash;ink of that, Moira, for a highlander!&rdquo; She
      glanced at Moira's face and read refusal there. &ldquo;But I insist you must go.
      A whole week in an awful stuffy train. This is the very thing for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the very thing, Moira,&rdquo; cried her brother. &ldquo;We will have a long talk
      this morning then in the afternoon we will do some business here, Mandy
      and I, and you can go up the Bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bow River. A glorious ride. Nothing like it even in Scotland, and
      that's saying a good deal,&rdquo; said her brother with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement appeared to give complete satisfaction to all parties
      except those most immediately interested, but there seemed to be no very
      sufficient reason with either to decline, hence they agreed.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RIDE UP THE BOW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Having once agreed to the proposal of a ride up the Bow, the doctor lost
      no time in making the necessary preparations. Half an hour later he found
      himself in the stable consulting with Billy. His mood was gloomy and his
      language reflected his mood. Gladly would he have escaped what to him, he
      felt, would be a trying and prolonged ordeal. But he could not do this
      without exciting the surprise of his friends and possibly wounding the
      sensitive girl whom he would gladly give his life to serve. He resolved
      that at all costs he would go through with the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give her a good time, by Jingo! if I bust something,&rdquo; he muttered as
      he walked up and down the stable picking out his mounts. &ldquo;But for a
      compound, double-opposed, self-adjusting jackass, I'm your choice. Lost my
      first chance. Threw it clean away and queered myself with her first shot.
      I say, Billy,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up, Doc?&rdquo; said Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kick me, Billy,&rdquo; said the doctor solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, Doc, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kick me, Billy, good and swift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't believe I could give no satisfaction, Doc. But there's that Hiram
      mule, he's a high class artist. You might back up to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use being kicked, Billy, by something that wouldn't appreciate it,&rdquo;
       said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't guess that way, Doc. He's an ornery cuss, he'd appreciate it all
      right, that old mule. But Doc, what's eatin' you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing, Billy, except that I'm an ass, an infernal ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ass, eh? Then I guess I couldn't give you no satisfaction. You better
      try that mule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Billy, the horses at two,&rdquo; said the doctor briskly, &ldquo;the broncho
      and that dandy little pinto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All serene, Doc. Hope you'll have a good time. Brace up, Doc, it's comin'
      to you.&rdquo; Billy's wink conveyed infinitely more than his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Billy, you cut that all out,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Doc, if that's the way you feel. You'll see no monkey-work on
      me. I'll make a preacher look like a sideshow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And truly Billy's manner was irreproachable as he stood with the ponies at
      the hotel door and helped their riders to mount. There was an almost sad
      gravity in his demeanor that suggested a mind preoccupied with solemn and
      unworldly thoughts with which the doctor and his affairs had not even the
      remotest association.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cameron who, with his wife, watched their departure from the balcony
      above, waved them farewell, he cried, &ldquo;Keep your eyes skinned for an
      Indian, Martin. Bring him in if you find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got no gun on me,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;and if I get sight of him,
      you hear me, I'll make for the timber quick. No heroic captures for me
      this trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this about the Indian, Dr. Martin?&rdquo; inquired the girl at his
      side as they cantered down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't your brother tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've done enough to you with that Indian already to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I like a fool frighten you nearly to death with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was startled. I was silly to show it. But an Indian to an Old
      Country person familiar with Fenimore Cooper, well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was a proper idiot all round this morning,&rdquo; grumbled the doctor. &ldquo;I
      didn't know what I was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brown eyes were open wide upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued the doctor desperately, &ldquo;I'd looked forward to
      meeting you for so long.&rdquo; The brown eyes grew wider. &ldquo;And then to think
      that I actually didn't know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't look at me,&rdquo; cried Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was looking for the girl I saw that day, almost three years ago, in
      the Glen. I have never forgotten that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor I,&rdquo; replied the girl softly. &ldquo;That is how I knew you. It was a
      terrible day to us all in the Glen, my brother going to leave us and under
      that dreadful cloud, and you came with the letter that cleared it all
      away. Oh, it was like the coming of an angel from heaven, and I have often
      thought, Mr. Martin&mdash;Dr. Martin you are now, of course&mdash;that I
      never thanked you as I ought that day. I was thinking of Allan. I have
      often wished to do it. I should like to do it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get at it,&rdquo; cried the doctor with great emphasis, &ldquo;I need it. It might
      help me a bit. I behaved so stupidly this morning. The truth is, I was
      completely knocked out, flabbergasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that it?&rdquo; cried Moira with a bright smile. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; A faint
      color tinged her pale cheek and she paused a moment. &ldquo;But tell me about
      the Indian. My brother just made little of it. It is his way with me. He
      thinks me just a little girl not to be trusted with things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't know you, then,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed gayly. &ldquo;And do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you better than that, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you know about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are to be trusted with that or with anything else that calls
      for nerve. Besides, sooner or later you must know about this Indian. Wait
      till we cross the bridge and reach the top of the hill yonder, it will be
      better going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hillside gave them a stiff scramble, for the trail went straight up.
      But the sure-footed ponies, scrambling over stones and gravel, reached the
      top safely, with no worse result than an obvious disarrangement of the
      girl's hair, so that around the Scotch bonnet which she had pinned on her
      head the little brown curls were peeping in a way that quite shook the
      heart of Dr. Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you look a little more like yourself,&rdquo; he cried, his eyes fastened
      upon the curls with unmistakable admiration, &ldquo;more like the girl I
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is my bonnet. I put on this old thing for the ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you wore no bonnet that day. It is your face, your
      hair, you are not quite&mdash;so&mdash;so proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hair!&rdquo; Her hands went up to her head. &ldquo;Oh, my silly curls, I suppose.
      They are my bane.&rdquo; (&ldquo;My joy,&rdquo; the doctor nearly had said.) &ldquo;But now for
      the Indian story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the doctor grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a pleasant thing to greet a guest with,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you must
      know it and I may as well give it to you. And, mind you, this is
      altogether a new thing with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the next half hour as they rode westward toward the big hills,
      steadily climbing as they went, the story of the disturbance in the north
      country, of the unrest among the Indians, of the part played in it by the
      Indian Copperhead, and of the appeal by the Superintendent to Cameron for
      assistance, furnished the topic for conversation. The girl listened with
      serious face, but there was no fear in the brown eyes, nor tremor in the
      quiet voice, as they talked it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us forget it for a while,&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;The Police have
      rarely, if ever, failed to get their man. That is their boast. And they
      will get this chap, too. And as for the row on the Saskatchewan, I don't
      take much stock in that. Now we're coming to a view in a few minutes, one
      of the finest I have seen anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For half a mile farther they loped along the trail that led them to the
      top of a hill that stood a little higher than the others round about. Upon
      the hilltop they drew rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that for a view?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them stretched the wide valley of the Bow for many miles, sweeping
      up toward the mountains, with rounded hills on either side, and far beyond
      the hills the majestic masses of the Rockies some fifty miles away,
      snow-capped, some of them, and here and there upon their faces the great
      glaciers that looked like patches of snow. Through this wide valley wound
      the swift flowing Bow, and up from it on either side the hills, rough with
      rocks and ragged masses of pine, climbed till they seemed to reach the
      very bases of the mountains beyond. Over all the blue arch of sky spanned
      the wide valley and seemed to rest upon the great ranges on either side,
      like the dome of a vast cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent, with lips parted and eyes alight with wonder, Moira sat and gazed
      upon the glory of that splendid scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think&mdash;&rdquo; began the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't speak,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;this is not for words, but for
      worship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long she continued to gaze in rapt silence upon the picture spread out
      before her. It was, indeed, a place for worship. She pointed to a hill
      some distance in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been beyond that?&rdquo; she asked in a hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have been all through this country. I know it well. From the top
      of that hill we get a magnificent sweep toward the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hillside they scrambled, across a little valley and up the
      farther side, following the trail that wound along the hill but declined
      to make the top. As they rounded the shoulder of the little mountain Moira
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a great view from the top there beyond the trees. Can we
      reach it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you good for a climb?&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;We could tie the horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer she flung herself from her pinto and, gathering up her habit,
      began eagerly to climb. By the time the doctor had tethered the ponies she
      was half way to the top. Putting forth all his energy he raced after her,
      and together they parted a screen of brushwood and stepped out on a clear
      rock that overhung the deep canyon that broadened into a great valley
      sweeping toward the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beats Scotland, eh?&rdquo; cried the doctor, as they stepped out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand upon his arm and drew him back into the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; she whispered. Surprised into silence, he stood gazing at her. Her
      face was white and her eyes gleaming. &ldquo;An Indian down there,&rdquo; she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Indian? Where? Show me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was looking up at us. Come this way. I think he heard us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him by a little detour and on their hands and knees they crept
      through the brushwood. They reached the open rock and peered down through
      a screen of bushes into the canyon below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; cried Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the little stream that flowed at the bottom of the canyon, and not
      more than a hundred yards away, stood an Indian, tall, straight and
      rigidly attent, obviously listening and gazing steadily at the point where
      they had first stood. For many minutes he stood thus rigid while they
      watched him. Then his attitude relaxed. He sat down upon the rocky ledge
      that sloped up from the stream toward a great overhanging crag behind him,
      laid his rifle beside him and, calmly filling his pipe, began to smoke.
      Intently they followed his every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe it is our Indian,&rdquo; whispered the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if we could only get him!&rdquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor glanced swiftly at her. Her face was pale but firm set with
      resolve. Quickly he revolved in his mind the possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only had a gun,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I'd risk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian was breaking off some dead twigs from the standing pines about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's going to light a fire,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;perhaps camp for the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried the girl in an excited whisper, &ldquo;we could get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled at her. The Indian soon had his fire going and,
      unrolling his blanket pack, he took thence what looked like a lump of
      meat, cut some strips from it and hung them from pointed sticks over the
      fire. He proceeded to gather some poles from the dead wood lying about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now is he going to do?&rdquo; inquired Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian proceeded to place the poles in order against the rock, keeping
      his eye on the toasting meat the while and now and again turning it before
      the fire. Then he began to cut branches of spruce and balsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the living Jingo!&rdquo; cried the doctor, greatly excited, &ldquo;I declare he's
      going to camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To sleep?&rdquo; said Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;He had no sleep last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;we can get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gazed at her in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can we get him? He'd double me up like a
      jack-knife. Remember I only played quarter,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried quickly, &ldquo;you stay here to watch him. Let me go back
      for the Police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; cried the doctor, &ldquo;you are a wonder. There's something in that.&rdquo;
       He thought rapidly, then said, &ldquo;No, it won't do. I can't allow you to risk
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risk? Risk what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A year ago the doctor would not have hesitated a moment to allow her to
      go, but now he thought of the roving bands of Indians and the possibility
      of the girl falling into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Cameron, it will not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we might get him and save Allan all the trouble
      and perhaps his life. You must not stop me. You cannot stop me. I am
      going. You wait and watch. Don't move. I can find my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What danger can there be?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;It is broad daylight. The road
      is good. I cannot possibly lose my way. I am used to riding alone among
      the hills at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, at home,&rdquo; said the doctor gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no danger,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;I am not afraid. Besides, you
      cannot keep me.&rdquo; She stood up among the bushes looking down at him with a
      face so fiercely resolved that he was constrained to say, &ldquo;By Jove! I
      don't believe I could. But I can go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not do that,&rdquo; she cried, stamping her foot, &ldquo;if I forbade you.
      It is your duty to stay here and watch that Indian. It is mine to go and
      get the Police. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I forbid you to come. You are not doing right. You are to
      stay. We will save my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glided through the bushes from his sight and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a fool or what?&rdquo; said the doctor to himself. &ldquo;She is taking a
      chance, but after all it is worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the middle of the afternoon and it would take Moira an hour and
      a half over that rocky winding trail to make the ten miles that lay before
      her. Ten minutes more would see the Police started on their return. The
      doctor settled himself down to his three hours' wait, keeping his eye
      fixed upon the Indian. The latter was now busy with his meal, which he ate
      ravenously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beggar has me tied up tight,&rdquo; muttered the doctor ruefully. &ldquo;My grub
      is on my saddle, and I guess I dare not smoke till he lights up himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand touched his arm. Instantly he was on his feet. It was Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Caesar, you scared me! Thought it was the whole Blackfoot tribe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be the better for something to eat,&rdquo; she said simply, handing
      him the lunch basket. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; he cried. But she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, she's a regular&mdash;&rdquo; He paused and thought for a moment. &ldquo;She's
      an angel, that's what&mdash;and a mighty sight better than most of them.
      She's a&mdash;&rdquo; He turned back to his watch, leaving his thought unspoken.
      In the presence of the greater passions words are woefully inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian was still eating as ravenously as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's filling up, I guess. He ought to be full soon at that rate. Wish
      he'd get his pipe agoing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In due time the Indian finished eating, rolled up the fragments carefully
      in a rag, and then proceeded to construct with the poles and brush which
      he had cut, a penthouse against the rock. At one end his little shelter
      thus constructed ran into a spruce tree whose thick branches reached right
      to the ground. When he had completed this shelter to his satisfaction he
      sat down again on the rock beside his smoldering fire and pulled out his
      pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks be!&rdquo; said the doctor to himself fervently. &ldquo;Go on, old boy, hit
      her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pipe and then another the Indian smoked, then, taking his gun, blanket
      and pack, he crawled into his brush wigwam out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you old beggar!&rdquo; said the doctor with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;You are
      safe for an hour or two, thank goodness. You had no sleep last night and
      you've got to make up for it now. Sleep tight, old boy. We'll give you a
      call.&rdquo; The doctor hugged himself with supreme satisfaction and continued
      to smoke with his eye fixed upon the hole into which the Indian had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the long hours he sat and smoked while he formulated the plan of
      attack which he proposed to develop when his reinforcements should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will work up behind him from away down the valley, a couple of us will
      cover him from the front and the others go right in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued with great care to make and revise his plans, and while in
      the midst of his final revision a movement in the bushes behind him
      startled him to his feet. The bushes parted and the face of Moira appeared
      with that of her brother over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he still there?&rdquo; she whispered eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep, snug as a bug. Never moved,&rdquo; said the doctor exultantly, and
      proceeded to explain his plan of attack. &ldquo;How many have you?&rdquo; he asked
      Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crisp and a constable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just two?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; replied Cameron briefly. &ldquo;That's plenty. Here they are.&rdquo; He stepped
      back through the bushes and brought forward Crisp and the constable. &ldquo;Now,
      then, here's our plan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You, Crisp, will go down the canyon,
      cross the stream and work up on the other side right to that rock. When
      you arrive at the rock the constable and I will go in. The doctor will
      cover him from this side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Fine, except that I propose to go in myself with
      you. He's a devil to fight. I could see that last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's really no use, you know, Doctor. The constable and I can handle
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moira stood looking eagerly from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;'nuff said. Only I'm going in. If you want
      to come along, suit yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do be careful,&rdquo; said Moira, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Oh, I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; said the doctor, looking at her quickly. &ldquo;You? Not much fear in
      you, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Moira, you stay here and keep your eye on
      him. You are safe enough here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her lips tight together till they made a thin red line in her
      white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you let me have a gun?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gun?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she can shoot&mdash;rabbits, at least,&rdquo; said her brother with a
      smile. &ldquo;I shall bring you one, Moira, but remember, handle it carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gun across her knees Moira sat and watched the development of the
      attack. For many minutes there was no sign or sound, till she began to
      wonder if a change had been made in the plan. At length some distance down
      the canyon and on the other side Sergeant Crisp was seen working his way
      with painful care step by step toward the rock of rendezvous. There was no
      sign of her brother or Dr. Martin. It was for them she watched with an
      intensity of anxiety which she could not explain to herself. At length
      Sergeant Crisp reached the crag against whose base the penthouse leaned in
      which the sleeping Indian lay. Immediately she saw her brother, quickly
      followed by Dr. Martin, leap the little stream, run lightly up the sloping
      rock and join Crisp at the crag. Still there was no sign from the Indian.
      She saw her brother motion the Sergeant round to the farther corner of the
      penthouse where it ran into the spruce tree, while he himself, with a
      revolver in each hand, dropped on one knee and peered under the leaning
      poles. With a loud exclamation he sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo; Like a hound on a scent he
      ran to the back of the spruce tree and on his knees examined the earth
      there. In a few moments his search was rewarded. He struck the trail and
      followed it round the rock and through the woods till he came to the hard
      beaten track. Then he came back, pale with rage and disappointment. &ldquo;He's
      gone!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear he never came out of that hole!&rdquo; said Dr. Martin. &ldquo;I kept my eye
      on it every minute of the last three hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another hole,&rdquo; said Crisp, &ldquo;under the tree here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron said not a word. His disappointment was too keen. Together they
      retraced their steps across the little stream. On the farther bank they
      found Moira, who had raced down to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed her brother. &ldquo;Gone for this time&mdash;but&mdash;some day&mdash;some
      day,&rdquo; he added below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But many things were to happen before that day came.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RAVEN TO THE RESCUE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Overhead the stars were still twinkling far in the western sky. The
      crescent moon still shone serene, marshaling her attendant constellations.
      Eastward the prairie still lay in deep shadow, its long rolls outlined by
      the deeper shadows lying in the hollows between. Over the Bow and the
      Elbow mists hung like white veils swathing the faces of the rampart hills
      north and south. In the little town a stillness reigned as of death, for
      at length Calgary was asleep, and sound asleep would remain for hours to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so the world about. Through the dead stillness of the waning night the
      liquid note of the adventurous meadow lark fell like the dropping of a
      silver stream into the pool below. Brave little heart, roused from slumber
      perchance by domestic care, perchance by the first burdening presage of
      the long fall flight waiting her sturdy careless brood, perchance stirred
      by the first thrill of the Event approaching from the east. For already in
      the east the long round tops of the prairie undulations are shining gray
      above the dark hollows and faint bars of light are shooting to the zenith,
      fearless forerunners of the dawn, menacing the retreating stars still
      bravely shining their pale defiance to the oncoming of their ancient foe.
      Far toward the west dark masses still lie invincible upon the horizon, but
      high above in the clear heavens white shapes, indefinite and unattached,
      show where stand the snow-capped mountain peaks. Thus the swift and silent
      moments mark the fortunes of this age-long conflict. But sudden all heaven
      and all earth thrill tremulous in eager expectancy of the daily miracle
      when, all unaware, the gray light in the eastern horizon over the roll of
      the prairie has grown to silver, and through the silver a streamer of
      palest rose has flashed up into the sky, the gay and gallant 'avant
      courier' of an advancing host, then another and another, then by tens and
      hundreds, till, radiating from a center yet unseen, ten thousand times ten
      thousand flaming flaunting banners flash into orderly array and possess
      the utmost limits of the heavens, sweeping before them the ever paling
      stars, that indomitable rearguard of the flying night, proclaiming to all
      heaven and all earth the King is come, the Monarch of the Day. Flushed in
      the new radiance of the morning, the long flowing waves of the prairie,
      the tumbling hills, the mighty rocky peaks stand surprised, as if caught
      all unprepared by the swift advance, trembling and blushing in the
      presence of the triumphant King, waiting the royal proclamation that it is
      time to wake and work, for the day is come.
    </p>
    <p>
      All oblivious of this wondrous miracle stands Billy, his powers of mind
      and body concentrated upon a single task, that namely of holding down to
      earth the game little bronchos, Mustard and Pepper, till the party should
      appear. Nearby another broncho, saddled and with the knotted reins hanging
      down from his bridle, stood viewing with all too obvious contempt the
      youthful frolics of the colts. Well he knew that life would cure them of
      all this foolish waste of spirit and of energy. Meantime on his part he
      was content to wait till his master&mdash;Dr. Martin, to wit&mdash;should
      give the order to move. His master meantime was busily engaged with clever
      sinewy fingers packing in the last parcels that represented the shopping
      activities of Cameron and his wife during the past two days. There was a
      whole living and sleeping outfit for the family to gather together.
      Already a heavily laden wagon had gone on before them. The building
      material for the new house was to follow, for it was near the end of
      September and a tent dwelling, while quite endurable, does not lend itself
      to comfort through a late fall in the foothill country. Besides, there was
      upon Cameron, and still more upon his wife, the ever deepening sense of a
      duty to be done that could not wait, and for the doing of that duty due
      preparation must be made. Hence the new house must be built and its simple
      appointments and furnishings set in order without delay, and hence the
      laden wagon gone before and the numerous packages in the democrat, covered
      with a new tent and roped securely into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This packing and roping the doctor made his peculiar care, for he was a
      true Canadian, born and bred in the atmosphere of pioneer days in old
      Ontario, and the packing and roping could be trusted to no amateur hands,
      for there were hills to go up and hills to go down, sleughs to cross and
      rivers to ford with all their perilous contingencies before they should
      arrive at the place where they would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All secure, Martin?&rdquo; said Cameron, coming out from the hotel with hand
      bags and valises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll stay, I think,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;unless those bronchos of
      yours get away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't they dears, Billy?&rdquo; cried Moira, coming out at the moment and
      dancing over to the bronchos' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, miss,&rdquo; said Billy with judicial care, &ldquo;I don't know about that.
      They're ornery little cusses and mean-actin.' They'll go straight enough
      if everything is all right, but let anythin' go wrong, a trace or a line,
      and they'll put it to you good and hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think I would be afraid of them,&rdquo; replied the girl, reaching out
      her hand to stroke Pepper's nose, a movement which surprised that broncho
      so completely that he flew back violently upon the whiffle-tree, carrying
      Billy with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up here, you beast!&rdquo; said Billy, giving him a fierce yank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy!&rdquo; expostulated Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he ain't no lady's maid, miss. You would, eh, you young devil,&rdquo;&mdash;this
      to Pepper, whose intention to walk over Billy was only too obvious&mdash;&ldquo;Get
      back there, will you! Now then, take that, and stand still!&rdquo; Billy
      evidently did not rely solely upon the law of love in handling his
      broncho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moira abandoned him and climbed to her place in the democrat between
      Cameron and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a most singular and fortunate coincidence Dr. Martin had learned that a
      patient of his at Big River was in urgent need of a call, so, to the open
      delight of the others and to the subdued delight of the doctor, he was to
      ride with them thus far on their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All set, Billy?&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;Let them go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Billy,&rdquo; cried both ladies, to which Billy replied with a wave of
      his Stetson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away plunged the bronchos on a dead gallop, as if determined to end the
      journey during the next half hour at most, and away with them went the
      doctor upon his steady broncho, the latter much annoyed at being thus
      ignominiously outdistanced by these silly colts and so induced to strike a
      somewhat more rapid pace than he considered wise at the beginning of an
      all-day journey. Away down the street between the silent shacks and stores
      and out among the straggling residences that lined the trail. Away past
      the Indian encampment and the Police Barracks. Away across the echoing
      bridge, whose planks resounded like the rattle of rifles under the flying
      hoofs. Away up the long stony hill, scrambling and scrabbling, but never
      ceasing till they reached the level prairie at the top. Away upon the
      smooth resilient trail winding like a black ribbon over the green bed of
      the prairie. Away down long, long slopes to low, wide valleys, and up
      long, long slopes to the next higher prairie level. Away across the plain
      skirting sleughs where ducks of various kinds, and in hundreds, quacked
      and plunged and fought joyously and all unheeding. Away with the morning
      air, rare and wondrously exhilarating, rushing at them and past them and
      filling their hearts with the keen zest of living. Away beyond sight and
      sound of the great world, past little shacks, the brave vanguard of
      civilization, whose solitary loneliness only served to emphasize their
      remoteness from the civilization which they heralded. Away from the haunts
      of men and through the haunts of wild things where the shy coyote, his
      head thrown back over his shoulder, loped laughing at them and their
      futile noisy speed. Away through the wide rich pasture lands where feeding
      herds of cattle and bands of horses made up the wealth of the solitary
      rancher, whose low-built wandering ranch house proclaimed at once his
      faith and his courage. Away and ever away, the shining morning hours and
      the fleeting miles racing with them, till by noon-day, all wet but still
      unweary, the bronchos drew up at the Big River Stopping Place, forty miles
      from the point of their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close behind the democrat rode Dr. Martin, the steady pace of his wise old
      broncho making up upon the dashing but somewhat erratic gait of the colts.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the ladies passed into the primitive Stopping Place, the men
      unhitched the ponies, stripped off their harness and proceeded to rub them
      down from head to heel, wash out their mouths and remove from them as far
      as they could by these attentions the travel marks of the last six hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big River could hardly be called even by the generous estimate of the
      optimistic westerner a town. It consisted of a blacksmith's shop, with
      which was combined the Post Office, a little school, which did for church&mdash;the
      farthest outpost of civilization&mdash;and a manse, simple, neat and tiny,
      but with a wondrous air of comfort about it, and very like the little Nova
      Scotian woman inside, who made it a very vestibule of heaven for many a
      cowboy and rancher in the district, and last, the Stopping Place run by a
      man who had won the distinction of being well known to the Mounted Police
      and who bore the suggestive name of Hell Gleeson, which appeared, however,
      in the old English Registry as Hellmuth Raymond Gleeson. The Mounted
      Police thought it worth while often to run in upon Hell at unexpected
      times, and more than once they had found it necessary to invite him to
      contribute to Her Majesty's revenue as compensation for Hell's
      objectionable habit of having in possession and of retailing to his
      friends bad whisky without attending to the little formality of a permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stopping Place was a rambling shack, or rather a series of shacks,
      loosely joined together, whose ramifications were found by Hell and his
      friends to be useful in an emergency. The largest room in the building was
      the bar, as it was called. Behind the counter, however, instead of the
      array of bottles and glasses usually found in rooms bearing this name, the
      shelf was filled with patent medicines, chiefly various brands of
      pain-killer. Off the bar was the dining-room, and behind the dining-room
      another and smaller room, while the room most retired in the collection of
      shacks constituting the Stopping Place was known in the neighborhood as
      the &ldquo;snake room,&rdquo; a room devoted to those unhappy wretches who, under the
      influence of prolonged indulgence in Hell's bad whisky, were reduced to
      such a mental and nervous condition that the landscape of their dreams
      became alive with snakes of various sizes, shapes and hues.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mandy familiarity had hardened her sensibilities to endurance of all
      the grimy uncleanness of the place, but to Moira the appearance of the
      house and especially of the dining-room filled her with loathing
      unspeakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mandy,&rdquo; she groaned, &ldquo;can we not eat outside somewhere? This is
      terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy thought for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but we will do better. I know Mrs. Macintyre in the
      manse. I nursed her once last spring. We will go and see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would not do,&rdquo; said Moira, her Scotch shy independence shrinking
      from such an intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't know me&mdash;and there are four of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, you don't know this country. You don't know what our visit
      will mean to the little woman, what a joy it will be to her to see a new
      face, and I declare when she hears you are new out from Scotland she will
      simply revel in you. We are about to confer a great favor upon Mrs.
      Macintyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Moira had any lingering doubts as to the soundness of her
      sister-in-law's opinion they vanished before the welcome she had from the
      minister's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cameron's sister?&rdquo; she cried, with both hands extended, &ldquo;and just out
      from Scotland? And where from? From near Braemar? And our folk came from
      near Inverness. Mhail Gaelic heaibh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go dearbh ha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on they went for some minutes in what Mrs. Macintyre called &ldquo;the dear
      old speech,&rdquo; till Mrs. Macintyre, remembering herself, said to Mandy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not understand the Gaelic? Well, well, you will forgive us.
      And to think that in this far land I should find a young lady like this to
      speak it to me! Do you know, I am forgetting it out here.&rdquo; All the while
      she was speaking she was laying the cloth and setting the table. &ldquo;And you
      have come all the way from Calgary this morning? What a drive for the
      young lady! You must be tired out. Would you lie down upon the bed for an
      hour? Then come away in to the bedroom and fresh yourselves up a bit. Come
      away in. I'll get Mr. Cameron over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are a big party,&rdquo; said Mandy, &ldquo;for your wee house. We have a friend
      with us&mdash;Dr. Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Martin? Indeed I know him well, and a fine man he is and that kind
      and clever. I'll get him too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go for them,&rdquo; said Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, go then. I'll just hurry the dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you quite sure,&rdquo; asked Mandy, &ldquo;you can&mdash;you have everything
      handy? You know, Mrs. Macintyre, I know just how hard it is to keep a
      stock of everything on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we have bread and molasses&mdash;our butter is run out, it is hard
      to get&mdash;and some bacon and potatoes and tea. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will do fine. And we have some things with us, if you don't
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind? Not a bit, my dear. You can just suit yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was a glorious success. The clean linen, the shining dishes,
      the silver&mdash;for Mrs. Macintyre brought out her wedding presents&mdash;gave
      the table a brilliantly festive appearance in the eyes of those who had
      lived for some years in the western country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't appreciate the true significance of a table napkin, I venture
      to say, Miss Cameron,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;until you have lived a year in
      this country at least, or how much an unspotted table cloth means, or
      shining cutlery and crockery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have been two days at the Royal Hotel, whatever,&rdquo; replied Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Royal Hotel!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor aghast. &ldquo;Our most palatial Western
      hostelry&mdash;all the comforts and conveniences of civilization!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I like this better,&rdquo; said Moira. &ldquo;It is like home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it, indeed, my dear?&rdquo; said the minister's wife greatly delighted. &ldquo;You
      have paid me a very fine tribute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hour lengthened into two, for when a departure was suggested the
      doctor grew eloquent in urging delay. The horses would be all the better
      for the rest. It would be fine driving in the evening. They could easily
      make the Black Dog Ford before dark. After that the trail was good for
      twenty miles, where they would camp. But like all happy hours these hours
      fled past, and all too swiftly, and soon the travelers were ready to
      depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Stopping Place door Hell was holding down the bronchos, while
      Cameron was packing in the valises and making all secure again. Near the
      wagon stood the doctor waiting their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going back from here, Dr. Martin?&rdquo; said Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I am going back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been good to see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope next time you will know
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now, Miss Cameron, don't rub it in. You see&mdash;but what's the
      use?&rdquo; continued the doctor. &ldquo;You had changed. My picture of the girl I had
      seen in the Highlands that day never changed and never will change.&rdquo; The
      doctor's keen gray eyes burned into hers for a moment. A slight flush came
      to her cheek and she found herself embarrassed for want of words. Her
      embarrassment was relieved by the sound of hoofs pounding down the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, who's this?&rdquo; said the doctor, as they stood watching the horseman
      approaching at a rapid pace and accompanied by a cloud of dust. Nearer and
      nearer he came, still on the gallop till within a few yards of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; cried Moira. &ldquo;Whoever he is he will run us down!&rdquo; and she sprang
      into her place in the democrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without slackening rein the rider came up to the Stopping Place door at a
      full gallop, then at a single word his horse planted his four feet solidly
      on the trail, and, plowing up the dirt, came to a standstill; then,
      throwing up his magnificent head, he gave a loud snort and stood, a
      perfect picture of equine beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a horse!&rdquo; breathed Moira. &ldquo;How perfectly splendid! And what a
      rider!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said the doctor, conscious of a feeling of hostility to the
      stranger, and all the more because he was forced to acknowledge to himself
      that the rider and his horse made a very striking picture. The man was
      tall and sinewy, with dark, clean-cut face, thin lips, firm chin and
      deep-set, brown-gray eyes that glittered like steel, and with that
      unmistakable something in his bearing that suggested the breeding of a
      gentleman. His horse was as distinguished as its rider. His coal black
      skin shone like silk, his flat legs, sloping hips, well-ribbed barrel,
      small head, large, flashing eyes, all proclaimed his high breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beauty! What a beauty!&rdquo; breathed Moira again to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to her praise the stranger, raising his Stetson, swept her
      an elaborate bow, and, touching his horse, moved nearer to the door of the
      Stopping Place and swung himself to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Cameron, it's you, sure enough. I can hardly believe my good
      fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Raven, that you?&rdquo; said Cameron indifferently. &ldquo;Hope you are fit?&rdquo;
       But he made no motion to offer his hand nor did he introduce him to the
      company. At the sound of his name Dr. Martin started and swept his keen
      eyes over the stranger's face. He had heard that name before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit?&rdquo; inquired the stranger whom Cameron had saluted as Raven. &ldquo;Fit as
      ever,&rdquo; a hard smile curling his lips as he noted Cameron's omission.
      &ldquo;Hello, Hell!&rdquo; he continued, his eyes falling upon that individual, who
      was struggling with the restive ponies, &ldquo;how goes it with your noble
      self?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hastily Hell, leaving the bronchos for the moment, responded, &ldquo;Hello, Mr.
      Raven, mighty glad to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the bronchos, freed from Hell's supervision, and apparently
      interested in the strange horse who was viewing them with lordly disdain,
      turned their heads and took the liberty of sniffing at the newcomer.
      Instantly, with mouth wide open and ears flat on his head, the black horse
      rushed at the bronchos. With a single bound they were off, the lines
      trailing in the dust. Together Hell, Cameron and the doctor sprang for the
      wagon, but before they could touch it it was whisked from underneath their
      fingers as the bronchos dashed in a mad gallop down the trail, Moira
      meantime clinging desperately to the seat of the pitching wagon. After
      them darted Cameron and for some moments it seemed as if he could overtake
      the flying ponies, but gradually they drew away and he gave up the chase.
      After him followed the whole company, his wife, the doctor, Hell, all in a
      blind horror of helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! My God!&rdquo; cried Cameron, his breath coming in sobbing gasps. &ldquo;The
      cut bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly were the words out of his mouth when Raven came up at an easy
      canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry,&rdquo; he said quietly to Mandy, who was wringing her hands in
      despair, &ldquo;I'll get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a swallow for swiftness and for grace, the black stallion sped away,
      flattening his body to the trail as he gathered speed. The bronchos had a
      hundred yards of a start, but they had not run another hundred until the
      agonized group of watchers could see that the stallion was gaining rapidly
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll get 'em,&rdquo; cried Hell, &ldquo;he'll get 'em, by gum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can he turn them from the bank?&rdquo; groaned Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything in horse-flesh or man-flesh can do it,&rdquo; said Hell, &ldquo;it'll be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a tail-race is a long race and a hundred yards' start is a serious
      handicap in a quarter of a mile. Down the sloping trail the bronchos were
      running savagely, their noses close to earth, their feet on the hard
      ground like the roar of a kettledrum, their harness and trappings
      fluttering over their backs, the wagon pitching like a ship in a gale, the
      girl clinging to its high seat as a sailor to a swaying mast. Behind, and
      swiftly drawing level with the flying bronchos, sped the black horse,
      still with that smooth grace of a skimming swallow and with such ease of
      motion as made it seem as if he could readily have increased his speed had
      he so chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! why doesn't he send the brute along?&rdquo; cried Dr. Martin, his stark
      face and staring eyes proclaiming his agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is up! He is up!&rdquo; cried Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agonized watchers saw the rider lean far over the bronchos and seize
      one line, then gradually begin to turn the flying ponies away from the cut
      bank and steer them in a wide circle across the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! Thank God! Oh, thank God!&rdquo; cried the doctor brokenly, wiping
      the sweat from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go to head them off,&rdquo; said Cameron, setting off at a run, leaving
      the doctor and his wife to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they watched with staring eyes the racing horses they saw Raven bring
      back the line to the girl clinging to the wagon seat, then the black
      stallion, shooting in front of the ponies, began to slow down upon them,
      hampering their running till they were brought to an easy canter, and,
      under the more active discipline of teeth and hoofs, were forced to a trot
      and finally brought to a standstill, and so held till Cameron and the
      doctor came up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven,&rdquo; gasped Cameron, fighting for his breath and coming forward with
      hand outstretched, &ldquo;you have&mdash;done&mdash;a great thing&mdash;to-day&mdash;for
      me. I shall not&mdash;forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut tut, Cameron, simple thing. I fancy you are still a few points
      ahead,&rdquo; said Raven, taking his hand in a strong grip. &ldquo;After all, it was
      Night Hawk did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saved&mdash;my sister's life,&rdquo; continued Cameron, still struggling
      for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, perhaps, but I don't forget,&rdquo; and here Raven leaned over his
      saddle and spoke in a lower voice, &ldquo;I don't forget the day you saved mine,
      my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;let me present you to my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Raven swung himself from his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand, Night Hawk!&rdquo; he commanded, and the horse stood like a soldier on
      guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moira,&rdquo; said Cameron, still panting hard, &ldquo;this is&mdash;my friend&mdash;Mr.
      Raven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raven stood bowing before her with his hat in his hand, but the girl
      leaned far down from her seat with both hands outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Raven,&rdquo; she said in a quiet voice, but her brown eyes
      were shining like stars in her white face. &ldquo;You are a wonderful rider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not have done it, Miss Cameron,&rdquo; said Raven, a wonderfully sweet
      smile lighting up his hard face, &ldquo;I could not have done it had you ever
      lost your nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no fear after I saw your face,&rdquo; said the girl simply. &ldquo;I knew you
      could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, and how did you know that?&rdquo; His gray-brown eyes searched her face
      more keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell. I just knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce my friend, Dr. Martin,&rdquo; said Cameron as the doctor came
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;too&mdash;want to thank you&mdash;Mr. Raven,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      seizing him with both hands. &ldquo;I never can&mdash;we never can forget it&mdash;or
      repay you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Raven, with a careless laugh, &ldquo;what else could I do? After all
      it was Night Hawk did the trick.&rdquo; He lifted his hat again to Moira, bowed
      with a beautiful grace, threw himself on his horse and stood till the two
      men, after carefully examining the harness and securing the reins, had
      climbed to their places on the wagon seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he trotted on before toward the Stopping Place, where the minister's
      wife and indeed the whole company of villagers awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, isn't he wonderful!&rdquo; cried Moira, with her eyes upon the rider in
      front of them. &ldquo;And he did it so easily.&rdquo; But the men sat silent. &ldquo;Who is
      he, Allan? You know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he is&mdash;he is a chap I met when I was on the Force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied her brother hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then? Does he live here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives somewhere south. Don't know exactly where he lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he? A rancher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rancher? Ah&mdash;yes, yes, he is a rancher I fancy. Don't know very
      well. That is&mdash;I have seen little of him&mdash;in fact&mdash;only a
      couple of times&mdash;or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to know you, Allan,&rdquo; said his sister a little reproachfully.
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she continued with a deep breath, &ldquo;he is just splendid.&rdquo; Dr.
      Martin glanced at her face glowing with enthusiasm and was shamefully
      conscious of a jealous pang at his heart. &ldquo;He is just splendid,&rdquo; continued
      Moira, with growing enthusiasm, &ldquo;and I mean to know more of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said her brother sharply, as if waking from a dream. &ldquo;Nonsense,
      Moira! You do not know what you are talking about. You must not speak like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, pray?&rdquo; asked his sister in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind just now, Moira. In this country we don't take up with
      strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangers?&rdquo; echoed the girl, pain mingling with her surprise. &ldquo;And yet he
      saved my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank God, he saved your life,&rdquo; cried her brother, &ldquo;and we shall
      never cease to be grateful to him, but&mdash;but&mdash;oh, drop it just
      now please, Moira. You don't know and&mdash;here we are. How white Mandy
      is. What a terrible experience for us all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible indeed,&rdquo; echoed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible?&rdquo; said Moira. &ldquo;It might have been worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this neither made reply, but there came a day when both doubted such a
      possibility.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SMITH'S WORK
    </h3>
    <p>
      The short September day was nearly gone. The sun still rode above the
      great peaks that outlined the western horizon. Already the shadows were
      beginning to creep up the eastern slope of the hills that clambered till
      they reached the bases of the great mountains. A purple haze hung over
      mountain, hill and rolling plain, softening the sharp outlines that
      ordinarily defined the features of the foothill landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the approach of evening the fierce sun heat had ceased and a fresh
      cooling western breeze from the mountain passes brought welcome
      refreshment alike to the travelers and their beasts, wearied with their
      three days' drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the last hill, Moira,&rdquo; cried her sister-in-law, pointing to a
      long slope before them. &ldquo;The very last, I promise you. From the top we can
      see our home. Our home, alas, I had forgotten! There is no home there,
      only a black spot on the prairie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband grunted savagely and cut sharply at the bronchos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the tent will be fine, Mandy. I just long for the experience,&rdquo; said
      Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but just think of all my pretty things, and some of Allan's too, all
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the pipes burned, Allan?&rdquo; cried Moira with a sudden anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they, Mandy? I never thought,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pipes? Let me see. No&mdash;no&mdash;you remember, Allan, young&mdash;what's
      his name?&mdash;that young Highlander at the Fort wanted them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough&mdash;Macgregor,&rdquo; said her husband in a tone of immense
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, young Mr. Macgregor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, but that is fine, Allan,&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;I should have grieved if
      we could not hear the pipes again among these hills. Oh, it is all so
      bonny; just look at the big Bens yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, as she said, all bonny. Far toward their left the low hills rolled
      in soft swelling waves toward the level prairie, and far away to the right
      the hills climbed by sharper ascents, flecked here and there with dark
      patches of fir, and broken with jutting ledges of gray limestone, climbed
      till they reached the great Rockies, majestic in their massive serried
      ranges that pierced the western sky. And all that lay between, the hills,
      the hollows, the rolling prairie, was bathed in a multitudinous riot of
      color that made a scene of loveliness beyond power of speech to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allan, Allan,&rdquo; cried his sister, &ldquo;I never thought to see anything as
      lovely as the Cuagh Oir, but this is up to it I do believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must indeed be lovely, then,&rdquo; said her brother with a smile, &ldquo;if you
      can say that. And I am glad you like it. I was afraid that you might not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are, just at the top,&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;In a minute beyond the
      shoulder there we shall see the Big Horn Valley and the place where our
      home used to be. There, wait Allan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ponies came to a stand. Exclamations of amazement burst from Cameron
      and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Allan? What? Is this the trail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the trail all right,&rdquo; said her husband in a low voice, &ldquo;but what in
      thunder does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a house, Allan, a new house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like it&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are people all about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some breathless moments they gazed upon the scene. A wide valley,
      flanked by hills and threaded by a gleaming river, lay before them and in
      a bend of the river against the gold and yellow of a poplar bluff stood a
      log house of comfortable size gleaming in all its newness fresh from the
      ax and saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it all mean, Allan?&rdquo; inquired his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blest if I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the people. I know now, Allan. It's a 'raising bee.' A raising
      bee!&rdquo; she cried with growing enthusiasm. &ldquo;You remember them in Ontario.
      It's a bee, sure enough. Oh, hurry, let's go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bronchos seemed to catch her excitement, their weariness disappeared,
      and, pulling hard on the bit, they tore down the winding trail as if at
      the beginning rather than at the end of their hundred and fifty mile
      drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a size!&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a cook house, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a verandah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a shingled roof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all the people! Where in the world can they have come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the Inspector, anyway,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;He is at the bottom of
      this, I'll bet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Cochrane! And that young Englishman, Mr. Newsome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And old Thatcher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Cochrane, and Mr. Dent, and, oh, there's my friend Smith! You
      remember he helped me put out the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon they were at the gate of the corral where a group of men and women
      stood awaiting them. Inspector Dickson was first:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Cameron! Got back, eh? Welcome home, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; he said as he
      helped her to alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith stood at the bronchos' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Inspector,&rdquo; said Cameron, holding him by hand and collar, &ldquo;now what
      does this business mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean?&rdquo; cried the Inspector with a laugh. &ldquo;Means just what you see. But
      won't you introduce us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all had been presented to his sister Cameron pursued his question.
      &ldquo;What does it mean, Inspector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean? Ask Cochrane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cochrane, tell me,&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;who began this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Mr. Thatcher there,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cochrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is responsible for this, Mr. Thatcher?&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't rightly know how the thing started. First thing I knowed they was
      all at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Thatcher, you might as well own up. I am going to know anyway.
      Where did the logs come from, for instance?&rdquo; said Cameron in a determined
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Logs? Guess Bracken knows,&rdquo; replied Cochrane, turning to a tall, lanky
      rancher who was standing at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bracken,&rdquo; cried Cameron, striding to him with hand outstretched, &ldquo;what
      about the logs for the house? Where did they come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dunno. Smith was sayin' somethin' about a bee and gettin' green
      logs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith?&rdquo; cried Cameron, glancing at that individual now busy unhitching
      the bronchos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; continued Bracken, &ldquo;green logs ain't any use for a real
      good house, so&mdash;and then&mdash;well, I happened to have a bunch of
      logs up the Big Horn. I guess the boys floated 'em down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away, Mrs. Cameron, and inspect your house,&rdquo; cried a stout,
      red-faced matron. &ldquo;I said they ought to await your coming to get your
      plans, but Mr. Smith said he knew a little about building and that they
      might as well go on with it. It was getting late in the season, and so
      they went at it. Come away, we're having a great time over it. Indeed, I
      think we've enjoyed it more than ever you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't told us yet who started it,&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get the lumber?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the lumber,&rdquo; replied Cochrane, &ldquo;came from the Fort, I guess. Didn't
      it, Inspector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Inspector. &ldquo;We had no immediate use for it, and Smith
      told us just how much it would take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith?&rdquo; said Cameron again. &ldquo;Hello, Smith!&rdquo; But Smith was already leading
      the bronchos away to the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the Inspector, &ldquo;and Smith was wondering how a notice
      could be sent up to the Spruce Creek boys and to Loon Lake, so I sent a
      man with the word and they brought down the lumber without any trouble.
      But,&rdquo; continued the Inspector, &ldquo;come along, Cameron, let us follow the
      ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is growing more and more mysterious,&rdquo; protested Cameron. &ldquo;Can no
      one tell me how the thing originated? The sash and doors now, where did
      they come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's easy,&rdquo; said Cochrane. &ldquo;I was at the Post Office, and, hearin'
      Smith talkin' 'bout this raisin' bee and how they were stuck for sash and
      door, so seein' I wasn't goin' to build this fall I told him he might as
      well have the use of these. My team was laid up and Smith got Jim Bracken
      to haul 'em down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this gets me,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;It appears no one started this thing.
      Everything just happened. Now the shingles, I suppose they just tumbled up
      into their place there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shingles?&rdquo; said Cochrane. &ldquo;I dunno 'bout them. Didn't know there were
      any in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they just got up into place there of themselves I have no doubt,&rdquo;
       said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shingles? Ah, bay Jove! Rawthah! Funny thing, don't-che-naow,&rdquo; chimed
      in a young fellow attired in rather emphasized cow-boy style, &ldquo;funny
      thing! A Johnnie&mdash;quite a strangah to me, don't-che-naow, was riding
      pawst my place lawst week and mentioned about this&mdash;ah&mdash;raisin'
      bee he called it I think, and in fact abaout the blawsted Indian, and the
      fire, don't-che-naow, and all the rest of it, and how the chaps were all
      chipping in as he said, logs and lumbah and so fowth. And then, bay Jove,
      he happened to mention that they were rathah stumped for shingles,
      don't-che-naow, and, funny thing, there chawnced to be behind my stable a
      few bunches, and I was awfully glad to tu'n them ovah, and this&mdash;eh&mdash;pehson&mdash;most
      extraordinary chap I assuah you&mdash;got 'em down somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it inquired?&rdquo; asked Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't naow him in the least. But it's the chap that seems to be bossing
      the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's Smith,&rdquo; said Cochrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith!&rdquo; said Cameron, in great surprise. &ldquo;I don't even know the man. He
      was good enough to help my wife to beat back the fire. I don't believe I
      even spoke to him. Who is he anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's Thatcher's man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away, Mr. Cameron,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cochrane from the door of the new
      house. &ldquo;Come away in and look at the result of our bee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This beats me,&rdquo; said Cameron, obeying the invitation, &ldquo;but, say, Dickson,
      it is mighty good of all these men. I have no claim&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claim?&rdquo; said Mr. Cochrane. &ldquo;It might have been any of us. We must stand
      together in this country, and especially these days, eh, Inspector? Things
      are gettin' serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector nodded his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But, Mr. Cochrane,&rdquo; he added in a low voice, &ldquo;it is very
      necessary that as little as possible should be said about these things
      just now. No occasion for any excitement or fuss. The quieter things are
      kept the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Inspector, I understand, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of your new house, Mr. Cameron?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cochrane.
      &ldquo;Come in. Now what do you think of this for three days' work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allan, I have been all through it and it's perfectly wonderful,&rdquo; said
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothing very wonderful, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said Cochrane, &ldquo;but it will do
      for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly wonderful in its whole plan, and beautifully complete,&rdquo;
       insisted Mandy. &ldquo;See, a living-room, a lovely large one, two bedrooms off
      it, and, look here, cupboards and closets, and a pantry, and&mdash;&rdquo; here
      she opened the door in the corner&mdash;&ldquo;a perfectly lovely up-stairs! Not
      to speak of the cook-house out at the back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful is the word,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;for why in all the world should
      these people&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And look, Allan, at Moira! She's just lost in rapture over that
      fireplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don't wonder,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;It is really fine. Whose idea was
      it?&rdquo; he continued, moving toward Moira's side, who was standing before a
      large fireplace of beautiful masonry set in between the two doors that led
      to the bedrooms at the far end of the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Andy Hepburn from Loon Lake that built it,&rdquo; said Mr. Cochrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could thank him,&rdquo; said Moira fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there he is outside the window, Miss Moira,&rdquo; said a young fellow
      who was supposed to be busy putting up a molding round the wainscoting,
      but who was in reality devoting himself to the young lady at the present
      moment with open admiration. &ldquo;Here, Andy,&rdquo; he cried through the window,
      &ldquo;you're wanted. Hurry up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't, Mr. Dent. What will he think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hairy little man, with a face dour and unmistakably Scotch, came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's want-it, then?&rdquo; he asked, with a deliberate sort of gruffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's yourself, Andy, me boy,&rdquo; said young Dent, who, though Canadian born,
      needed no announcement of his Irish ancestry. &ldquo;It is yourself, Andy, and
      this young lady, Miss Moira Cameron&mdash;Mr. Hepburn&mdash;&rdquo; Andy made
      reluctant acknowledgment of her smile and bow&mdash;&ldquo;wants to thank you
      for this fireplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very beautiful indeed, Mr. Hepburn, and very thankful I am to you
      for building it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, it's no that bad,&rdquo; admitted Andy. &ldquo;But ye need not thank me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you built it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye did I. But no o' ma ain wull. A fireplace is a feckless thing in this
      country an' I think little o't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose idea was it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was yon Smith buddie. He juist keepit dingin' awa' till A promised if
      he got the lime&mdash;A kent o' nane in the country&mdash;A wud build the
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he got the lime, eh, Andy?&rdquo; said Dent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, he got it,&rdquo; said Andy sourly. &ldquo;Diel kens whaur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am sure you did it beautifully, Mr. Hepburn,&rdquo; said Moira, moving
      closer to him, &ldquo;and it will be making me think of home.&rdquo; Her soft Highland
      accent and the quaint Highland phrasing seemed to reach a soft spot in the
      little Scot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hame? An' whaur's that?&rdquo; he inquired, manifesting a grudging interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Where but in the best of all lands, in Scotland,&rdquo; said Moira.
      &ldquo;Near Braemar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Braemar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, Braemar. I have only come four days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, an' did ye say, lassie!&rdquo; said Andy, with a faint accession of
      interest. &ldquo;It's a bonny country ye've left behind, and far enough frae
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far indeed,&rdquo; said Moira, letting her shining brown eyes rest upon his
      face. &ldquo;And it is myself that knows it. But when the fire burns yonder,&rdquo;
       she added, pointing to the fireplace, &ldquo;I will be seeing the hills and the
      glens and the moors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, then, lassie,&rdquo; said Andy in a low hurried voice, moving toward the
      door, &ldquo;A'm gled that Smith buddie gar't me build it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Mr. Hepburn,&rdquo; said Moira, shyly holding out her hand, &ldquo;don't you
      think that Scotties in this far land should be friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' prood I'd be, Miss Cameron,&rdquo; replied Andy, and, seizing her hand, he
      gave it a violent shake, flung it from him and fled through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a cure, now, isn't he!&rdquo; said Dent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is fine,&rdquo; said Moira with enthusiasm. &ldquo;It takes a Scot to
      understand a Scot, you see, and I am glad I know him. Do you know, he is a
      little like the fireplace himself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;rugged, a wee bit rough,
      but fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real stuff, eh?&rdquo; said Dent. &ldquo;The pure quill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is it. Solid and steadfast, with no pretense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the work of inspecting the new house was going on. Everywhere
      appeared fresh cause for delighted wonder, but still the origin of the
      raising bee remained a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balked by the men, Cameron turned in his search to the women and proceeded
      to the tent where preparations were being made for the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut tut, Mr. Cameron,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cochrane, her broad good-natured face
      beaming with health and good humor, &ldquo;what difference does it make? Your
      neighbors are only too glad of a chance to show their goodwill for
      yourself, and more for your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are right there,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is the way of the country. We must stick together, John says. It's
      your turn to-day, it may be ours to-morrow and that's all there is to it.
      So clear out of this tent and make yourself busy. By the way, where's the
      pipes? The folk will soon be asking for a tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to know, Mrs. Cochrane,&rdquo; persisted Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the pipes, I'm saying. John,&rdquo; she cried, lifting her voice, to
      her husband, who was standing at the other side of the house. &ldquo;Where's the
      pipes? They're not burned, I hope,&rdquo; she continued, turning to Cameron.
      &ldquo;The whole settlement would feel that a loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately no. Young Macgregor at the Fort has them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wonder if they are here. John, find out from the Inspector yonder
      where the pipes are. We will be wanting them this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her husband's inquiry the Inspector replied that if Macgregor ever had
      the pipes it was a moral certainty that he had carried them with him to
      the raising, &ldquo;for it is my firm belief,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that he sleeps with
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go and see now, like a dear man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cochrane to Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      From group to group of the workers Cameron went, exchanging greetings, but
      persistently seeking to discover the originator of the raising bee. But
      all in vain, and in despair he came back to his wife with the question
      &ldquo;Who is this Smith, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Smith,&rdquo; she said with deliberate emphasis, &ldquo;is my friend, my
      particular friend. I found him a friend when I needed one badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but who is he?&rdquo; inquired Moira, who, with Mr. Dent in attendance,
      had sauntered up. &ldquo;Who is he, Mr. Dent? Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not from Adam's mule. He's old Thatcher's man. That's all I know
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Mr. Thatcher's man? Oh!&rdquo; said Moira, &ldquo;Mr. Thatcher's servant.&rdquo; A
      subtle note of disappointment sounded in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Servant, Moira?&rdquo; said Allan in a shocked tone. &ldquo;Wipe out the thought.
      There is no such thing as servant west of the Great Lakes in this country.
      A man may help me with my work for a consideration, but he is no servant
      of mine as you understand the term, for he considers himself just as good
      as I am and he may be considerably better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allan,&rdquo; protested his sister with flushing face, &ldquo;I know. I know all
      that, but you know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know perfectly,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;for I had the same notion. For
      instance, for six months I was a 'servant' in Mandy's home, eh, Mandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Mandy indignantly. &ldquo;You were our hired man and just like
      the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you get that distinction, Moira? There is no such thing as servant in
      this country,&rdquo; continued Cameron. &ldquo;We are all the same socially and stand
      to help each other. Rather a fine idea that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fine,&rdquo; cried Moira, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; and she paused, her face still
      flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Smith? is the great question,&rdquo; interjected Dent. &ldquo;Well, then, Miss
      Cameron, between you and me we don't ask that question in this country.
      Smith is Smith and Jones is Jones and that's the first and last of it. We
      all let it go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now the last row of shingles was in place, the last door hung, the
      last door-knob set. The whole house stood complete, inside and out, top
      and bottom, when a tattoo beat upon a dish pan gave the summons to the
      supper table. The table was spread in all its luxurious variety and
      abundance beneath the poplar trees. There the people gathered all upon the
      basis of pure democratic equality, &ldquo;Duke's son and cook's son,&rdquo; each
      estimated at such worth as could be demonstrated was in him. Fictitious
      standards of values were ignored. Every man was given his fair opportunity
      to show his stuff and according to his showing was his place in the
      community. A generous good fellowship and friendly good-will toward the
      new-comer pervaded the company, but with all this a kind of reserve marked
      the intercourse of these men with each other. Men were taken on trial at
      face value and no questions asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening, however, the dominant note was one of generous and
      enthusiastic sympathy with the young rancher and his wife, who had come so
      lately among them and who had been made the unfortunate victim of a
      sinister and threatening foe, hitherto, it is true, regarded with
      indifference or with friendly pity but lately assuming an ominous
      importance. There was underneath the gay hilarity of the gathering an
      undertone of apprehension until the Inspector made his speech. It was
      short and went straight at the mark. There was danger, he acknowledged. It
      would be idle to ignore that there were ugly rumors flying. There was need
      for watchfulness, but there was no need for alarm. The Police Force was
      charged with the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of
      the people. They assumed to the full this responsibility, though they were
      very short-handed at present, but if they ever felt they needed assistance
      they knew they could rely upon the steady courage of the men of the
      district such as he saw before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was need of no further words and the Inspector's speech passed with
      no response. It was not after the manner of these men to make
      demonstration either of their loyalty or of their courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron's speech at the last came haltingly. On the one hand his Highland
      pride made it difficult for him to accept gifts from any source whatever.
      On the other hand his Highland courtesy forbade his giving offense to
      those who were at once his hosts and his guests, but none suspected the
      reason for the halting in his speech. As Western men they rather approved
      than otherwise the hesitation and reserve that marked his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they rose from the supper table, however, there were calls for Mrs.
      Cameron, calls so insistent and clamorous that, overcoming her
      embarrassment, she made reply. &ldquo;We have not yet found out who was
      responsible for the originating of this great kindness. But no matter. We
      forgive him, for otherwise my husband and I would never have come to know
      how rich we are in true friends and kind neighbors, and now that you have
      built this house let me say that henceforth by day or by night you are
      welcome to it, for it is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the storm of applause had died down, a voice was heard gruffly and
      somewhat anxiously protesting, &ldquo;But not all at one time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; asked Mandy of young Dent as the supper party broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Smith,&rdquo; said Dent, &ldquo;and he's a queer one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith?&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;The chap meets us everywhere. I must look him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was a universal and insistent demand for &ldquo;the pipes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look him up, Mandy,&rdquo; cried her husband as he departed in response to
      the call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall find him, and all about him,&rdquo; said Mandy with determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two hours were spent in dancing to Cameron's reels, in which all,
      with more or less grace, took part till the piper declared he was clean
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Macgregor have the pipes, Cameron,&rdquo; cried the Inspector. &ldquo;He is
      longing for a chance, I am sure, and you give us the Highland Fling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come Moira,&rdquo; cried Cameron gaily, handing the pipes to Macgregor and,
      taking his sister by the hand, he led her out into the intricacies of the
      Highland Reel, while the sides of the living-room, the doors and the
      windows, were thronged with admiring onlookers. Even Andy Hepburn's rugged
      face lost something of its dourness; and as the brother and sister
      together did that most famous of all the ancient dances of Scotland, the
      Highland Fling, his face relaxed into a broad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Smith,&rdquo; said young Dent to Mandy in a low voice as the reel was
      drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have been looking for him everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, at the window, outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in the dim light of the lanterns and candles hung here and there upon
      the walls and stuck on the window sills, Smith's face, pale, stern, sad,
      shone like a specter out of the darkness behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with the man?&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;I must find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the reel came to an end and Cameron, taking the pipes from young
      Macgregor, cried, &ldquo;Now, Moira, we will give them our way of it,&rdquo; and,
      tuning the pipes anew, he played over once and again their own Glen March,
      known only to the piper of the Cuagh Oir. Then with cunning skill making
      atmosphere, he dropped into a wild and weird lament, Moira standing the
      while like one seeing a vision. With a swift change the pipes shrilled
      into the true Highland version of the ancient reel, enriched with grace
      notes and variations all his own. For a few moments the girl stood as if
      unwilling to yield herself to the invitation of the pipes. Suddenly, as if
      moved by another spirit than her own, she stepped into the circle and
      whirled away into the mazes of the ancient style of the Highland Fling,
      such as is mastered by comparatively few even of the Highland folk. With
      wonderful grace and supple strength she passed from figure to figure and
      from step to step, responding to the wild mad music as to a master spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the dance Mandy made her way out of the house and round to
      the window where Smith stood gazing in upon the dancer. She quietly
      approached him from behind and for a few moments stood at his side. He was
      breathing heavily like a man in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; she said, touching him gently on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang from her touch as from a stab and darted back from the crowd
      about the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; she said again, following him. &ldquo;You are not well.
      You are in pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment or two gazing at her with staring eyes and parted lips,
      pain, grief and even rage distorting his pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wicked,&rdquo; at length he panted. &ldquo;It is just terrible wicked&mdash;a
      young girl like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wicked? Who? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;that girl&mdash;dancing like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dancing? That kind of dancing?&rdquo; cried Mandy, astonished. &ldquo;I was brought
      up a Methodist myself,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but that kind of dancing&mdash;why,
      I love it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of the devil. I am a Methodist&mdash;a preacher&mdash;but I could
      not preach, so I quit. But that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil
      and&mdash;and I have not the courage to denounce it. She is&mdash;God help
      me&mdash;so&mdash;so wonderful&mdash;so wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; said Mandy, laying her hand upon his arm, and seeking to
      sooth his passion, &ldquo;surely this dancing is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud cheers and clapping of hands from the house interrupted her. The man
      put his hands over his eyes as if to shut out a horrid vision, shuddered
      violently, and with a weird sound broke from her touch and fled into the
      bluff behind the house just as the party came streaming from the house
      preparatory to departing. It seemed to Mandy as if she had caught a
      glimpse of the inner chambers of a soul and had seen things too sacred to
      be uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the last to leave were young Dent and the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have found out the culprit,&rdquo; cried Dent, as he was saying good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The culprit?&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow who has engineered this whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, listen,&rdquo; said Dent. &ldquo;Who got the logs from Bracken? Smith. Who got
      the Inspector to send men through the settlement? Smith. Who got the
      lumber out of the same Inspector? Smith. And the sash and doors out of
      Cochrane? Smith. And wiggled the shingles out of Newsome? And euchred old
      Scotty Hepburn into building the fireplace? And planned and bossed the
      whole job? Who? Smith. This whole business is Smith's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is Smith? Have you seen him, Mandy? We have not thanked him,&rdquo;
       said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone, I think,&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;He left some time ago. We shall thank
      him later. But I am sure we owe a great deal to you, Inspector Dickson, to
      you, Mr. Dent, and indeed to all our friends,&rdquo; she added, as she bade them
      good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments they lingered in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that this is Smith's work!&rdquo; said Cameron, waving his hand toward
      the house. &ldquo;That queer chap! One thing I have learned, never to judge a
      man by his legs again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Mandy indignantly, &ldquo;and with a fine soul in
      spite of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wobbly legs,&rdquo; said her husband smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a shame, Allan. What difference does it make what kind of legs a man
      has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; replied her husband smiling, &ldquo;and if you knew your Bible
      better, Mandy, you would have found excellent authority for your position
      in the words of the psalmist, 'The Lord taketh no pleasure in the legs of
      a man.' But, say, it is a joke,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to think of this being Smith's
      work.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN THE SUN DANCE CANYON
    </h3>
    <p>
      But they were not yet done with Smith, for as they turned to pass into the
      house a series of shrill cries from the bluff behind pierced the stillness
      of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Help! Murder! Help! I've got him! Help! I've got him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shaking off the clutching hands of his wife and sister, Cameron darted
      into the bluff and found two figures frantically struggling upon the
      ground. The moonlight trickling through the branches revealed the man on
      top to be an Indian with a knife in his hand, but he was held in such
      close embrace that he could not strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; cried Cameron, seizing the Indian by the wrist. &ldquo;Stop that! Let
      him go!&rdquo; he cried to the man below. &ldquo;I've got him safe enough. Let him go!
      Let him go, I tell you! Now, then, get up! Get up, both of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The under man released his grip, allowed the Indian to rise and got
      himself to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out into the light!&rdquo; said Cameron sharply, leading the Indian out of
      the bluff, followed by the other, still panting. Here they were joined by
      the ladies. &ldquo;Now, then, what the deuce is all this row?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's Mr. Smith!&rdquo; cried Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith again! More of Smith's work, eh? Well, this beats me,&rdquo; said her
      husband. For some moments Cameron stood surveying the group, the Indian
      silent and immobile as one of the poplar trees beside him, the ladies with
      faces white, Smith disheveled in garb, pale and panting and evidently
      under great excitement. Cameron burst into a loud laugh. Smith's pale face
      flushed a swift red, visible even in the moonlight, then grew pale again,
      his excited panting ceased as he became quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what is the row?&rdquo; asked Cameron again. &ldquo;What is it, Smith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found this Indian in the bush here and I seized him. I thought&mdash;he
      might&mdash;do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;some mischief&mdash;to some of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You found this Indian in the bluff here and you just jumped on him?
      You might better have jumped on a wild cat. Are you used to this sort of
      thing? Do you know the ways of these people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw an Indian before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens, man! He might have killed you. And he would have in two
      minutes more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have killed&mdash;some of you,&rdquo; said Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what were you doing in the bluff?&rdquo; he said sharply, turning to the
      Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chief Trotting Wolf,&rdquo; said the Indian in the low undertone common to his
      people, &ldquo;Chief Trotting Wolf want you' squaw&mdash;boy seeck bad&mdash;leg
      beeg beeg. Boy go die. Come.&rdquo; He turned to Mandy and repeated &ldquo;Come&mdash;queeek&mdash;queeek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you come earlier?&rdquo; said Cameron sharply. &ldquo;It is too late now.
      We are going to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me come dis.&rdquo; He lowered his hand toward the ground. &ldquo;Too much mans&mdash;no
      like&mdash;Indian wait all go 'way&mdash;dis man much beeg fight&mdash;no
      good. Come queeek&mdash;boy go die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already Mandy had made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hurry, Allan,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't go to-night,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You are dead tired. Wait till
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, we must go.&rdquo; She turned into the house, followed by her husband,
      and began to rummage in her bag. &ldquo;Lucky thing I got these supplies in
      town,&rdquo; she said, hastily putting together her nurse's equipment and some
      simple remedies. &ldquo;I wonder if that boy has fever. Bring that Indian in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had the doctor?&rdquo; she inquired, when he appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Doctor want cut off leg&mdash;dis,&rdquo; his action was sufficiently
      suggestive. &ldquo;Boy say no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the boy any fever? Does he talk-talk-talk?&rdquo; The Indian nodded his
      head vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk much&mdash;all day&mdash;all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is evidently in a high fever,&rdquo; said Mandy to her husband. &ldquo;We must try
      to check that. Now, my dear, you hurry and get the horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what shall we do with Moira?&rdquo; said Cameron suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried Moira, &ldquo;let me go with you. I should love to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this did not meet with Cameron's approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stay here,&rdquo; suggested Smith hesitatingly, &ldquo;or Miss Cameron can go
      over with me to the Thatchers'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; said Cameron shortly. &ldquo;We can drop her at the Thatchers'
      as we pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour Cameron returned with the horses and the party proceeded
      on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Piegan Reserve they were met by Chief Trotting Wolf himself and,
      without more than a single word of greeting, were led to the tent in which
      the sick boy lay. Beside him sat the old squaw in a corner of the tent,
      crooning a weird song as she swayed to and fro. The sick boy lay on a
      couch of skins, his eyes shining with fever, his foot festering and in a
      state of indescribable filth and his whole condition one of unspeakable
      wretchedness. Cameron found his gorge rise at the sight of the gangrenous
      ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a horrid business, Mandy,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is not for you.
      Let us send for the doctor. That foot will surely have to come off. Don't
      mess with it. Let us have the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his wife, from the moment of her first sight of the wounded foot,
      forgot all but her mission of help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have a clean tent, Allan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and plenty of hot water.
      Get the hot water first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron turned to the Chief and said, &ldquo;Hot water, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh&mdash;good,&rdquo; replied the Chief, and in a few moments returned with a
      small pail of luke-warm water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Mandy, &ldquo;it must be hot and we must have lots of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot,&rdquo; cried Cameron to the Chief. &ldquo;Big pail&mdash;hot&mdash;hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted the Chief a second time with growing intelligence, and in
      an incredibly short space returned with water sufficiently hot and in
      sufficient quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All unconscious of the admiring eyes that followed the swift and skilled
      movements of her capable hands, Mandy worked over the festering and
      fevered wound till, cleansed, soothed, wrapped in a cooling lotion, the
      limb rested easily upon a sling of birch bark and skins suggested and
      prepared by the Chief. Then for the first time the boy made a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he grunted feebly. &ldquo;Doctor&mdash;no good. Squaw&mdash;heap good. Me
      two foot&mdash;live&mdash;one foot&mdash;&rdquo; he held up one finger&mdash;&ldquo;die.&rdquo;
       His eyes were shining with something other than the fever that drove the
      blood racing through his veins. As a dog's eyes follow every movement of
      his master so the lad's eyes, eloquent with adoring gratitude, followed
      his nurse as she moved about the wigwam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we must get that clean tent, Allan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;It will be no easy job, but we shall do
      our best. Here, Chief,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;get some of your young men to pitch
      another tent in a clean place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief, eager though he was to assist, hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No young men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get squaw,&rdquo; and departed abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No young men, eh?&rdquo; said Cameron to his wife. &ldquo;Where are they, then? I
      notice there are no bucks around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so while the squaws were pitching a tent in a spot somewhat removed
      from the encampment, Cameron poked about among the tents and wigwams of
      which the Indian encampment consisted, but found for the most part only
      squaws and children and old men. He came back to his wife greatly
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young bucks are gone, Mandy. I must get after this thing quickly. I
      wish I had Jerry here. Let's see? You ask for a messenger to be sent to
      the fort for the doctor and medicine. I shall enclose a note to the
      Inspector. We want the doctor here as soon as possible and we want Jerry
      here at the earliest possible moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a great show of urgency a messenger was requisitioned and dispatched,
      carrying a note from Cameron to the Commissioner requesting the presence
      of the doctor with his medicine bag, but also requesting that Jerry, the
      redoubtable half-breed interpreter and scout, with a couple of constables,
      should accompany the doctor, the constables, however, to wait outside the
      camp until summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the hours that must elapse before any answer could be had from the
      fort, Cameron prepared a couch in a corner of the sick boy's tent for his
      wife, and, rolling himself in his blanket, he laid himself down at the
      door outside where, wearied with the long day and its many exciting
      events, he slept without turning, till shortly after daybreak he was
      awakened by a chorus of yelping curs which heralded the arrival of the
      doctor from the fort with the interpreter Jerry in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, prepared by Jerry with dispatch and skill, the product of
      long experience, there was a thorough examination of the sick boy's
      condition through the interpreter, upon the conclusion of which a long
      consultation followed between the doctor, Cameron and Mandy. It was
      finally decided that the doctor should remain with Mandy in the Indian
      camp until a change should become apparent in the condition of the boy,
      and that Cameron with the interpreter should pick up the two constables
      and follow in the trail of the young Piegan braves. In order to allay
      suspicion Cameron and his companion left the camp by the trail which led
      toward the fort. For four miles or so they rode smartly until the trail
      passed into a thick timber of spruce mixed with poplar. Here Cameron
      paused, and, making a slight sign in the direction from which they had
      come, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop back, Jerry, and see if any Indian is following.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; grunted Jerry. &ldquo;Go slow one mile,&rdquo; and, slipping from his pony, he
      handed the reins to Cameron and faded like a shadow into the brushwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a mile Cameron rode, pausing now and then to listen for the sound of
      anyone following, then drew rein and waited for his companion. After a few
      minutes of eager listening he suddenly sat back in his saddle and felt for
      his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Jerry,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grinning somewhat shamefacedly Jerry parted a bunch of spruce boughs and
      stood at Cameron's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good ears,&rdquo; he said, glancing up into Cameron's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jerry,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;I saw the blue-jay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Jerry, &ldquo;dat fool bird tell everyt'ing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any Indian following?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry held up two fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two Indian run tree mile&mdash;find notting&mdash;go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Where are our men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down Coulee Swampy Creek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Jerry. Any news at the fort last two or three days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beeg meetin' St. Laurent. Much half-breed. Some Indian too. Louis Riel
      mak beeg spik&mdash;beeg noise&mdash;blood! blood! blood! Much beeg fool.&rdquo;
       Jerry's tone indicated the completeness of his contempt for the whole
      proceedings at St. Laurent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something doing, eh, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; grunted Jerry contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's something doing here,&rdquo; continued Cameron. &ldquo;Trotting Wolf's
      young men have left the reserve and Trotting Wolf is very anxious that we
      should not know it. I want you to go back, find out what direction they
      have taken, how far ahead they are, how many. We camp to-night at the Big
      Rock at the entrance to the Sun Dance Canyon. You remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something doing, Jerry, or I am much mistaken. Got any grub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grub?&rdquo; asked Jerry. &ldquo;Me&mdash;here&mdash;t'ree day,&rdquo; tapping his rolled
      blanket at the back of his saddle. &ldquo;Odder fellers&mdash;grub&mdash;Jakes&mdash;t'ree
      men&mdash;t'ree day. Come Beeg Rock to-night&mdash;mebbe to-morrow.&rdquo; So
      saying, Jerry climbed on to his pony and took the back trail, while
      Cameron went forward to meet his men at the Swampy Creek Coulee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a somewhat wide detour to avoid the approaches to the Indian
      encampment, Cameron and his two men rode for the Big Rock at the entrance
      to the Sun Dance Canyon. They gave themselves no concern about Trotting
      Wolf's band of young men. They knew well that what Jerry could not
      discover would not be worth finding out. A year's close association with
      Jerry had taught Cameron something of the marvelous powers of observation,
      of the tenacity and courage possessed by the little half-breed that made
      him the keenest scout in the North West Mounted Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Big Rock they arrived late in the afternoon and there waited for
      Jerry's appearing; but night had fallen and had broken into morning before
      the scout came into camp with a single word of report:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Piegans?&rdquo; exclaimed Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not dis side Blood Reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat something, Jerry, then we will talk,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry had already broken his fast, but was ready for more. After the meal
      was finished he made his report. His report was clear and concise. On
      leaving Cameron in the morning he had taken the most likely direction to
      discover traces of the Piegan band, namely that suggested by Cameron, and,
      fetching a wide circle, had ridden toward the mountains, but he had come
      upon no sign. Then he had penetrated into the canyon and ridden down
      toward the entrance, but still had found no trace. He had then ridden
      backward toward the Piegan Reserve and, picking up a trail of one or two
      ponies, had followed it till he found it broaden into that of a
      considerable band making eastward. Then he knew he had found the trail he
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many, Jerry?&rdquo; asked Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-breed held up both hands three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty or forty?&rdquo; exclaimed Cameron. &ldquo;Any Squaws?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunting-expedition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were they going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood Reserve t'ink&mdash;dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron sat smoking in silence. He was completely at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why go to the Bloods?&rdquo; he asked of Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry was not strong in his constructive faculty. His powers were those of
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no sense in them going to the Blood Reserve, Jerry,&rdquo; said
      Cameron impatiently. &ldquo;The Bloods are a pack of thieves, we know, but our
      people are keeping a close watch on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry grunted acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no big Indian camping ground on the Blood Reserve. You wouldn't
      get the Blackfeet to go to any pow-wow there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Jerry grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far did you follow their trail, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;t'ree mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron sat long and smoked. The thing was extremely puzzling. It seemed
      unlikely that if the Piegan band were going to a rendezvous of Indians
      they should select a district so closely under the inspection of the
      Police. Furthermore there was no great prestige attaching to the Bloods to
      make their reserve a place of meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; said Cameron at length, &ldquo;I believe they are up this Sun Dance
      Canyon somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jerry decisively. &ldquo;No sign&mdash;come down mesef.&rdquo; His tone was
      that of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, Jerry, they doubled back and came in from the north end after
      you had left. I feel sure they are up there now and we will go and find
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry sat silent, smoking thoughtfully. Finally he took his pipe from his
      mouth, pressed the tobacco hard down with his horny middle finger and
      stuck it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe so,&rdquo; he said slowly, a slight grin distorting his wizened little
      face, &ldquo;mebbe so, but t'ink not&mdash;me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jerry, where could they have gone? They might ride straight to
      Crowfoot's Reserve, but I think that is extremely unlikely. They certainly
      would not go to the Bloods, therefore they must be up this canyon. We will
      go up, Jerry, for ten miles or so and see what we can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jerry with a grunt, his tone conveying his conviction that
      where the chief scout of the North West Mounted Police had said it was
      useless to search, any other man searching would have nothing but his
      folly for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a sleep first, Jerry. We need not start for a couple of hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry grunted his usual reply, rolled himself in his blanket and, lying
      down at the back of a rock, was asleep in a minute's time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two hours to the minute he stood beside his pony waiting for Cameron,
      who had been explaining his plan to the two constables and giving them his
      final orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orders were very brief and simple. They were to wait where they were
      till noon. If any of the band of Piegans appeared one of the men was to
      ride up the canyon with the information, the other was to follow the band
      till they camped and then ride back till he should meet his comrades. They
      divided up the grub into two parts and Cameron and the interpreter took
      their way up the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canyon consisted of a deep cleft across a series of ranges of hills or
      low mountains. Through it ran a rough breakneck trail once used by the
      Indians and trappers but now abandoned since the building of the Canadian
      Pacific Railway through the Kicking Horse Pass and the opening of the
      Government trail through the Crow's Nest. From this which had once been
      the main trail other trails led westward into the Kootenays and eastward
      into the Foothill country. At times the canyon widened into a valley, rich
      in grazing and in streams of water, again it narrowed into a gorge, deep
      and black, with rugged sides above which only the blue sky was visible,
      and from which led cavernous passages that wound into the heart of the
      mountains, some of them large enough to hold a hundred men or more without
      crowding. These caverns had been and still were found to be most
      convenient and useful for the purpose of whisky-runners and of
      cattle-rustlers, affording safe hiding-places for themselves and their
      spoil. With this trail and all its ramifications Jerry was thoroughly
      familiar. The only other man in the Force who knew it better than Jerry
      was Cameron himself. For many months he had patroled the main trail and
      all its cross leaders, lived in its caves and explored its caverns in
      pursuit of those interesting gentlemen whose activities more than anything
      else had rendered necessary the existence of the North West Mounted
      Police. In ancient times the caves along the Sun Dance Trail had been used
      by the Indian Medicine-Men for their pagan rites, and hence in the eyes of
      the Indians to these caves attached a dreadful reverence that made them
      places to be avoided in recent years by the various tribes now gathered on
      the reserves. But during these last months of unrest it was suspected by
      the Police that the ancient uses of these caves had been revived and that
      the rites long since fallen into desuetude were once more being practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few miles of the canyon the trail offered good footing and
      easy going, but as the gorge deepened and narrowed the difficulties
      increased until riding became impossible, and only by the most strenuous
      efforts on the part of both men and beasts could any advance be made. And
      so through the day and into the late evening they toiled on, ever alert
      for sight or sound of the Piegan band. At length Cameron broke the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must camp, Jerry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are making no time and we may spoil
      things. I know a good camp-ground near by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; grunted Jerry, who was as tired as his wiry frame ever allowed
      him to become.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took a trail leading eastward, which to all eyes but those familiar
      with it would have been invisible, for a hundred yards or so and came to
      the bed of a dry stream which issued from between two great rocks. Behind
      one of these rocks there opened out a grassy plot a few yards square, and
      beyond the grass a little lifted platform of rock against a sheer cliff.
      Here they camped, picketing their horses on the grass and cooking their
      supper upon the platform of rock over a tiny fire of dry twigs, for the
      wind was blowing down the canyon and they knew that they could cook their
      meal and have their smoke without fear of detection. For some time after
      supper they sat smoking in that absolute silence which is the
      characteristic of the true man of the woods. The gentle breeze blowing
      down the canyon brought to their ears the rustling of the dry
      poplar-leaves and the faint murmur of the stream which, tumbling down the
      canyon, accompanied the main trail a hundred yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Cameron's hand fell upon the knee of the half-breed with a swift
      grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said, bending forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      With mouths slightly open and with hands to their ears they both sat
      motionless, breathless, every nerve on strain. Gradually the dead silence
      seemed to resolve itself into rhythmic waves of motion rather than of
      sound&mdash;&ldquo;TUM-ta-ta-TUM. TUM-ta-ta-TUM. TUM-ta-ta-TUM.&rdquo; It was the
      throb of the Indian medicine-drum, which once heard can never be forgotten
      or mistaken. Without a word to each other they rose, doused their fire,
      cached their saddles, blankets and grub, and, taking only their revolvers,
      set off up the canyon. Before they had gone many yards Cameron halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Jerry?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I take it they have come in the back
      way over the old Porcupine Trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry grunted approval of the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we can go in from the canyon. It is hard going, but there is less
      fear of detection. They are sure to be in the Big Wigwam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry shook his head, with a puzzled look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where they are,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Come on! Only two miles from
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steadily the throb of the medicine-drum grew more distinct as they moved
      slowly up the canyon, rising and falling upon the breeze that came down
      through the darkness to meet them. The trail, which was bad enough in the
      light, became exceedingly dangerous and difficult in the blackness of the
      night. On they struggled painfully, now clinging to the sides of the
      gorge, now mounting up over a hill and again descending to the level of
      the foaming stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they have sentries out, I wonder?&rdquo; whispered Cameron in Jerry's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;beeg medicine going on&mdash;no sentry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, we will walk straight in on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you do?&rdquo; inquired Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see what they are doing and send them about their business,&rdquo; said
      Cameron shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jerry firmly. &ldquo;S'pose Indian mak beeg medicine&mdash;bes' leave
      him go till morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jerry, we will take a look at them at any rate,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;But
      if they are fooling around with any rebellion nonsense I am going to step
      in and stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jerry again very gravely. &ldquo;Beeg medicine mak' Indian man crazy&mdash;fool&mdash;dance&mdash;sing&mdash;mak'
      brave&mdash;then keel&mdash;queeck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then, Jerry,&rdquo; said Cameron impatiently. And on they went. The
      throb of the drum grew clearer until it seemed that the next turn in the
      trail should reveal the camp, while with the drum throb they began to
      catch, at first faintly and then more clearly, the monotonous chant
      &ldquo;Hai-yai-kai-yai, Hai-yai-kai-yai,&rdquo; that ever accompanies the Indian
      dance. Suddenly the drums ceased altogether and with it the chanting, and
      then there arose upon the night silence a low moaning cry that gradually
      rose into a long-drawn penetrating wail, almost a scream, made by a single
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry's hand caught Cameron's arm with a convulsive grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is that?&rdquo; asked Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sioux Indian&mdash;he mak' dat when he go keel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the long weird wailing scream pierced the night and, echoing
      down the canyon, was repeated a hundred times by the black rocky sides.
      Cameron could feel Jerry's hand still quivering on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up with you, Jerry?&rdquo; said Cameron impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me hear dat when A'm small boy&mdash;me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Cameron remembered that it was Sioux blood that colored the
      life-stream in Jerry's veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; said Cameron with gruff impatience. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; But he was
      more shaken than he cared to acknowledge by that weird unearthly cry and
      by its all too obvious effect upon the iron nerves of that little
      half-breed at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey mak' dat cry when dey go meet Custer long 'go,&rdquo; said Jerry, making no
      motion to go forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; said Cameron harshly. &ldquo;Come along, unless you
      want to go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words stung the half-breed into action. Cameron could feel him in the
      dark jerk his hand away and hear him grit his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! You go hell!&rdquo; he muttered between his clenched teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; said Cameron cheerfully. &ldquo;Now we will look in upon these
      fire-eaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sharp to the right they turned behind a cliff, and then back almost upon
      their trail, still to the right, through a screen of spruce and poplar,
      and found themselves in a hole of a rock that lengthened into a tunnel
      blacker than the night outside. Pursuing this tunnel some little distance
      they became aware of a light that grew as they moved toward it into a fire
      set in the middle of a wide cavern. The cavern was of irregular shape,
      with high-vaulted roof, open to the sky at the apex and hung with
      glistening stalactites. The floor of this cavern lay slightly below them,
      and from their position they could command a full view of its interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sides of the cavern round about were crowded with tawny faces of
      Indians arranged rank upon rank, the first row seated upon the ground,
      those behind crouching upon their haunches, those still farther back
      standing. In the center of the cavern and with his face lit by the fire
      stood the Sioux Chief, Onawata.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperhead! By all that's holy!&rdquo; cried Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onawata!&rdquo; exclaimed the half-breed. &ldquo;What he mak' here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he saying, Jerry? Tell me everything&mdash;quick!&rdquo; commanded
      Cameron sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry was listening with eager face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He mak' beeg spik,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He say Indian long tam' 'go have all country when his fadder small boy.
      Dem day good hunting&mdash;plenty beaver, mink, moose, buffalo like leaf
      on tree, plenty hit (eat), warm wigwam, Indian no seeck, notting wrong.
      Dem day Indian lak' deer go every place. Dem day Indian man lak' bear
      'fraid notting. Good tam', happy, hunt deer, keel buffalo, hit all day.
      Ah-h-h! ah-h-h!&rdquo; The half-breed's voice faded in two long gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sioux's chanting voice rose and fell through the vaulted cavern like a
      mighty instrument of music. His audience of crowding Indians gazed in
      solemn rapt awe upon him. A spell held them fixed. The whole circle swayed
      in unison with his swaying form as he chanted the departed glories of
      those happy days when the red man roamed free those plains and woods, lord
      of his destiny and subject only to his own will. The mystic magic power of
      that rich resonant voice, its rhythmic cadence emphasized by the soft
      throbbing of the drum, the uplifted face glowing as with prophetic fire,
      the tall swaying form instinct with exalted emotion, swept the souls of
      his hearers with surging tides of passion. Cameron, though he caught but
      little of its meaning, felt himself irresistibly borne along upon the
      torrent of the flowing words. He glanced at Jerry beside him and was
      startled by the intense emotion showing upon his little wizened face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a swift change of motif, and with it a change of tone
      and movement and color. The marching, vibrant, triumphant chant of freedom
      and of conquest subsided again into the long-drawn wail of defeat, gloom
      and despair. Cameron needed no interpreter. He knew the singer was telling
      the pathetic story of the passing of the day of the Indian's glory and the
      advent of the day of his humiliation. With sharp rising inflections, with
      staccato phrasing and with fierce passionate intonation, the Sioux wrung
      the hearts of his hearers. Again Cameron glanced at the half-breed at his
      side and again he was startled to note the transformation in his face.
      Where there had been glowing pride there was now bitter savage hate. For
      that hour at least the half-breed was all Sioux. His father's blood was
      the water in his veins, the red was only his Indian mother's. With face
      drawn tense and lips bared into a snarl, with eyes gleaming, he gazed
      fascinated upon the face of the singer. In imagination, in instinct, in
      the deepest emotions of his soul Jerry was harking back again to the
      savage in him, and the savage in him thirsting for revenge upon the white
      man who had wrought this ruin upon him and his Indian race. With a fine
      dramatic instinct the Sioux reached his climax and abruptly ceased. A low
      moaning murmur ran round the circle and swelled into a sobbing cry, then
      ceased as suddenly as there stepped into the circle a stranger, evidently
      a half-breed, who began to speak. He was a French Cree, he announced, and
      delivered his message in the speech, half Cree, half French, affected by
      his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come fresh from the North country, from the disturbed district, and
      bore, as it appeared, news of the very first importance from those who
      were the leaders of his people in the unrest. At his very first word Jerry
      drew a long deep breath and by his face appeared to drop from heaven to
      earth. As the half-breed proceeded with his tale his speech increased in
      rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he saying, Jerry?&rdquo; said Cameron after they had listened for some
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh he beeg damfool!&rdquo; said Jerry, whose vocabulary had been learned mostly
      by association with freighters and the Police. &ldquo;He tell 'bout beeg
      meeting, beeg man Louis Riel mak' beeg noise. Bah! Beeg damfool!&rdquo; The
      whole scene had lost for Jerry its mystic impressiveness and had become
      contemptibly commonplace. But not so to Cameron. This was the part that
      held meaning for him. So he pulled up the half-breed with a quick, sharp
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen close,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and let me know what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Jerry interpreted in his broken English the half-breed's speech it
      appeared that there was something worth learning. At this big meeting held
      in Batoche it seemed a petition of rights, to the Dominion Parliament no
      less, had been drawn up, and besides this many plans had been formed and
      many promises made of reward for all those who dared to stand for their
      rights under the leadership of the great Riel, while for the Indians very
      special arrangements had been made and the most alluring prospects held
      out. For they were assured that, when in the far North country the new
      Government was set up, the old free independent life of which they had
      been hearing was to be restored, all hampering restrictions imposed by the
      white man were to be removed, and the good old days were to be brought
      back. The effect upon the Indians was plainly evident. With solemn faces
      they listened, nodding now and then grave approval, and Cameron felt that
      the whole situation held possibilities of horror unspeakable in the
      revival of that ancient savage spirit which had been so very materially
      softened and tamed by years of kindly, patient and firm control on the
      part of those who represented among them British law and civilization. His
      original intention had been to stride in among these Indians, to put a
      stop to their savage nonsense and order them back to their reserves with
      never a thought of anything but obedience on their part. But as he glanced
      about upon the circle of faces he hesitated. This was no petty outbreak of
      ill temper on the part of a number of Indians dissatisfied with their
      rations or chafing under some new Police regulation. As his eye traveled
      round the circle he noted that for the most part they were young men. A
      few of the councilors of the various tribes represented were present. Many
      of them he knew, but many others he could not distinguish in the dim light
      of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are those Indians, Jerry?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Jerry ran over the names he began to realize how widely
      representative of the various tribes in the western country the gathering
      was. Practically every reserve in the West was represented: Bloods,
      Piegans and Blackfeet from the foothill country, Plain Crees and Wood
      Crees from the North. Even a few of the Stonies, who were supposed to have
      done with all pagan rites and to have become largely civilized, were
      present. Nor were these rank and file men only. They were the picked
      braves of the tribes, and with them a large number of the younger chiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the half-breed Cree finished his tale, and in a few brief fierce
      sentences he called the Indians of the West to join their half-breed and
      Indian brothers of the North in one great effort to regain their lost
      rights and to establish themselves for all time in independence and
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed grave discussion carried on with deliberation and courtesy
      by those sitting about the fire, and though gravity and courtesy marked
      every utterance there thrilled through every speech an ever deepening
      intensity of feeling. The fiery spirit of the red man, long subdued by
      those powers that represented the civilization of the white man, was
      burning fiercely within them. The insatiable lust for glory formerly won
      in war or in the chase, but now no longer possible to them, burned in
      their hearts like a consuming fire. The life of monotonous struggle for a
      mere existence to which they were condemned had from the first been
      intolerable to them. The prowess of their fathers, whether in the
      slaughter of foes or in the excitement of the chase, was the theme of song
      and story round every Indian camp-fire and at every sun dance. For the
      young braves, life, once vivid with color and thrilling with tingling
      emotions, had faded into the somber-hued monotony of a dull and spiritless
      existence, eked out by the charity of the race who had robbed them of
      their hunting-grounds and deprived them of their rights as free men. The
      lust for revenge, the fury of hate, the yearning for the return of the
      days of the red man's independence raged through their speeches like fire
      in an open forest; and, ever fanning yet ever controlling the flame, old
      Copperhead presided till the moment should be ripe for such action as he
      desired. Back and forward the question was deliberated. Should they there
      and then pledge themselves to their Northern brothers and commit
      themselves to this great approaching adventure?
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly and with an air of judicial deliberation the Sioux put the
      question to them. There was something to be lost and something to be
      gained. But the loss, how insignificant it seemed! And the gain, how
      immeasurable! And after all success was almost certain. What could prevent
      it? A few scattered settlers with no arms nor ammunition, with no means of
      communication, what could they effect? A Government nearly three thousand
      miles away, with the nearest base of military operations a thousand miles
      distant, what could they do? The only real difficulty was the North West
      Mounted Police. But even as the Sioux uttered the words a chill silence
      fell upon the excited throng. The North West Mounted Police, who for a
      dozen years had guarded them and cared for them and ruled them without
      favor and without fear! Five hundred red coats of the Great White Mother
      across the sea, men who had never been known to turn their backs upon a
      foe, who laughed at noisy threats and whose simple word their greatest
      chief was accustomed unhesitatingly to obey! Small wonder that the mere
      mention of the name of those gallant &ldquo;Riders of the Plains&rdquo; should fall
      like a chill upon their fevered imaginations. The Sioux was conscious of
      that chill and set himself to counteract it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Police!&rdquo; he cried with unspeakable scorn, &ldquo;the Police! They will flee
      before the Indian braves like leaves before the autumn wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What says he?&rdquo; cried Cameron eagerly. And Jerry swiftly interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment's hesitation Cameron sprang to his feet and, standing in
      the dim light at the entrance to the cave, with arm outstretched and
      finger pointed at the speaker, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; With a sudden start every face was turned in his direction.
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;The Sioux dog lies. He speaks with double tongue.
      Never have the Indians seen a Policeman's back turned in flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His unexpected appearance, his voice ringing like the blare of a trumpet
      through the cavern, his tall figure with the outstretched accusing arm and
      finger, the sharp challenge of the Sioux's lie with what they all knew to
      be the truth, produced an effect utterly indescribable. For some brief
      seconds they gazed upon him stricken into silence as with a physical blow,
      then with a fierce exclamation the Sioux snatched a rifle from the cave
      side and quicker than words can tell fired straight at the upright
      accusing figure. But quicker yet was Jerry's panther-spring. With a
      backhand he knocked Cameron flat, out of range. Cameron dropped to the
      floor as if dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce do you mean, Jerry?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You nearly knocked the
      wind out of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beeg fool you!&rdquo; grunted Jerry fiercely, dragging him back into the tunnel
      out of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, Jerry!&rdquo; cried Cameron in a rage, struggling to free himself
      from the grip of the wiry half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mak' still!&rdquo; hissed Jerry, laying his hand over Cameron's mouth. &ldquo;Indian
      mad&mdash;crazy&mdash;tak' scalp sure queeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, Jerry, you little fool!&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;I'll kill you if you
      don't! I want that Sioux, and, by the eternal God, I am going to have
      him!&rdquo; He shook himself free of the half-breed's grasp and sprang to his
      feet. &ldquo;I am going to get him!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Jerry again, flinging himself upon him and winding his arms
      about him. &ldquo;Wait! Nodder tam'. Indian mad crazy&mdash;keel quick&mdash;no
      talk&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up and down the tunnel Cameron dragged him about as a mastiff might a
      terrier, striving to free himself from those gripping arms. Even as Jerry
      spoke, through the dim light the figure of an Indian could be seen passing
      and repassing the entrance to the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get him soon,&rdquo; said Jerry in an imploring whisper. &ldquo;Come back now&mdash;queeck&mdash;beeg
      hole close by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a great effort Cameron regained his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, you are right, Jerry,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;We certainly can't take
      him now. But we must not lose him. Now listen to me quick. This passage
      opens on to the canyon about fifty yards farther down. Follow, and keep
      your eye on the Sioux. I shall watch here. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without an instant's hesitation Jerry obeyed, well aware that his master
      had come to himself and again was in command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron meantime groped to the mouth of the tunnel by which he had entered
      and peered out into the dim light. Close to his hand stood an Indian in
      the cavern. Beyond him there was a confused mingling of forms as if in
      bewilderment. The Council was evidently broken up for the time. The
      Indians were greatly shaken by the vision that had broken in upon them.
      That it was no form of flesh and blood was very obvious to them, for the
      Sioux's bullet had passed through it and spattered against the wall
      leaving no trail of blood behind it. There was no holding them together,
      and almost before he was aware of it Cameron saw the cavern empty of every
      living soul. Quickly but warily he followed, searching each nook as he
      went, but the dim light of the dying fire showed him nothing but the black
      walls and gloomy recesses of the great cave. At the farther entrance he
      found Jerry awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they gone?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beeg camp close by,&rdquo; replied Jerry. &ldquo;Beeg camp&mdash;much Indian. Some
      talk-talk, then go sleep. Chief Onawata he mak' more talk&mdash;talk all
      night&mdash;then go sleep. We get him morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron thought swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are right, Jerry. Now you get back quick for the men and come
      to me here in the morning. We must not spoil the chance of capturing this
      old devil. He will have these Indians worked up into rebellion before we
      know where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Cameron set forward that he might with his own eyes look upon
      the camp and might the better plan his further course. Upon two things he
      was firmly resolved. First, that he should break up this council which
      held such possibilities of danger to the peace of the country. And
      secondly, and chiefly, he must lay hold of this Sioux plotter, not only
      because of the possibilities of mischief that lay in him, but because of
      the injury he had done him and his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forward, then, he went and soon came upon the camp, and after observing
      the lay of it, noting especially the tent in which the Sioux Chief had
      disposed himself, he groped back to his cave, in a nook of which&mdash;for
      he was nearly done out with weariness, and because much yet lay before him&mdash;he
      laid himself down and slept soundly till the morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN THE BIG WIGWAM
    </h3>
    <p>
      Long before the return of the half-breed and his men Cameron was astir and
      to some purpose. A scouting expedition around the Indian camp rewarded him
      with a significant and useful discovery. In a bluff some distance away he
      found the skins and heads of four steers, and by examination of the brands
      upon the skins discovered two of them to be from his own herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, my braves,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;There will be a reckoning for this
      some day not so far away. Meantime this will help this day's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A night's sleep and an hour's quiet consideration had shown him the folly
      of a straight frontal attack upon the Indians gathered for conspiracy.
      They were too deeply stirred for anything like the usual brusque manner of
      the Police to be effective. A slight indiscretion, indeed, might kindle
      such a conflagration as would sweep the whole country with the devastating
      horror of an Indian war. He recalled the very grave manner of Inspector
      Dickson and resolved upon an entirely new plan of action. At all costs he
      must allay suspicion that the Police were at all anxious about the
      situation in the North. Further, he must break the influence of the Sioux
      Chief over these Indians. Lastly, he was determined that this arch-plotter
      should not escape him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was just visible over the lowest of the broken foothills when
      Jerry and the two constables made their appearance, bringing, with them
      Cameron's horse. After explaining to them fully his plan and emphasizing
      the gravity of the situation and the importance of a quiet, cool and
      resolute demeanor, they set off toward the Indian encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no intention of stirring these chaps up,&rdquo; laid Cameron, &ldquo;but I am
      determined to arrest old Copperhead, and at the right moment we must act
      boldly and promptly. He is too dangerous and much too clever to be allowed
      his freedom among these Indians of ours at this particular time. Now,
      then, Jerry and I will ride in looking for cattle and prepared to charge
      these Indians with cattle-stealing. This will put them on the defensive.
      Then the arrest will follow. You two will remain within sound of whistle,
      but failing specific direction let each man act on his own initiative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry listened with delight. His Chief was himself again. Before the day
      was over he was to see him in an entirely new role. Nothing in life
      afforded Jerry such keen delight as a bit of cool daring successfully
      carried through. Hence with joyous heart he followed Cameron into the
      Indian camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning hour is the hour of coolest reason. The fires of emotion and
      imagination have not yet begun to burn. The reactions from anything like
      rash action previously committed under the stimulus of a heated
      imagination are caution and timidity, and upon these reactions Cameron
      counted when he rode boldly into the Indian camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one swift glance his eye swept the camp and lighted upon the Sioux
      Chief in the center of a group of younger men, his tall commanding figure
      and haughty carriage giving him an outstanding distinction over those
      about him. At his side stood a young Piegan Chief, Eagle Feather by name,
      whom Cameron knew of old as a restless, talkative Indian, an ambitious
      aspirant for leadership without the qualities necessary to such a
      position. Straight to this group Cameron rode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; he said, saluting the group. &ldquo;Ah, good morning, Eagle
      Feather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Feather grunted an indistinct reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Hunt, eh? Are you in command of this party, Eagle Feather? No? Who
      then is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Piegan turned and pointed to a short thick set man standing by another
      fire, whose large well shaped head and penetrating eye indicated both
      force and discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Running Stream,&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;Come over here, Running Stream. I am
      glad to see you, for I wish to talk to a man of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and with dignified, almost unwilling step Running Stream
      approached. As he began to move, but not before, Cameron went to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to talk with you,&rdquo; said Cameron in a quiet firm tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Running Stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a matter of importance to speak to you about,&rdquo; continued Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running Stream's keen glance searched his face somewhat anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find, Running Stream, that your young men are breaking faith with their
      friends, the Police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Chief searched Cameron's face with that keen swift glance, but
      he said not a word, only waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are breaking the law as well, and I want to tell you they will be
      punished. Where did they get the meat for these kettles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of relief gleamed for one brief instant across the Indian's face,
      not unnoticed, however, by Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do your young men steal my cattle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian evinced indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno&mdash;deer&mdash;mebbe&mdash;sheep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother speaks like a child,&rdquo; said Cameron quietly. &ldquo;Do deer and sheep
      have steers' heads and hides with brands on? Four heads I find in the
      bluff. The Commissioner will ask you to explain these hides and heads, and
      let me tell you, Running Stream, that the thieves will spend some months
      in jail. They will then have plenty of time to think of their folly and
      their wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An ugly glance shot from the Chief's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; he grunted again, then began speaking volubly in the Indian
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak English, Running Stream!&rdquo; commanded Cameron. &ldquo;I know you can speak
      English well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Running Stream shook his head and continued his speech in Indian,
      pointing to a bluff near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron looked toward Jerry, who interpreted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He say young men tak' deer and sheep and bear. He show you skins in
      bluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Running Stream, supplementing Jerry's interpretation and
      making toward the bluff. Cameron followed him and came upon the skins of
      three jumping deer, of two mountain sheep and of two bear. They turned
      back again to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young men no take cattle,&rdquo; said the Chief with haughty pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;but some of your party have, Running Stream,
      and the Commissioner will look to you. You are in command here. He will
      give you a chance to clear yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian shrugged his shoulders and stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is not doing well,&rdquo; continued Cameron. &ldquo;The Government feed
      you if you are hungry. The Government protect you if you are wronged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an unfortunate word of Cameron's. A sudden cloud of anger darkened
      the Indian's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried aloud. &ldquo;My children&mdash;my squaw and my people go hungry&mdash;go
      cold in winter&mdash;no skin&mdash;no meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother knows&mdash;&rdquo; replied Cameron with patient firmness&mdash;&ldquo;You
      translate this, Jerry&rdquo;&mdash;and Jerry proceeded to translate with
      eloquence and force&mdash;&ldquo;the Government never refuse you meat. Last
      winter your people would have starved but for the Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried the Indian again in harsh quick reply, the rage in his face
      growing deeper, &ldquo;my children cry&mdash;Indian cannot sleep&mdash;my white
      brother's ears are closed. He hear only the wind&mdash;the storm&mdash;he
      sound sleep. For me no sleep&mdash;my children cry too loud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother knows,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;that the Government is far away,
      that it takes a long time for answer to come back to the Indian cry. But
      the answer came and the Indian received flour and bacon and tea and sugar,
      and this winter will receive them again. But how can my brother expect the
      Government to care for his people if the Indians break the law? That is
      not good. These Indians are bad Indians and the Police will punish the
      thieves. A thief is a bad man and ought to be punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a new voice broke in abruptly upon the discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who steal the Indian's hunting-ground? Who drive away the buffalo?&rdquo; The
      voice rang with sharp defiance. It was the voice of Onawata, the Sioux
      Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron paid no heed to the ringing voice. He kept his back turned upon
      the Sioux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother knows,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to Running Stream,
      &ldquo;that the Indian's best friend is the Government, and the Police are the
      Government's ears and eyes and hands and are ready always to help the
      Indians, to protect them from fraud, to keep away the whisky-peddlers, to
      be to them as friends and brothers. But my brother has been listening to a
      snake that comes from another country and that speaks with a forked
      tongue. Our Government bought the land by treaty. Running Stream knows
      this to be no lie, but the truth. Nor did the Government drive away the
      buffalo from the Indians. The buffalo were driven away by the Sioux from
      the country of the snake with the forked tongue. My brother remembers that
      only a few years ago when the people to which this lying snake belongs
      came over to this country and tried to drive away from their
      hunting-grounds the Indians of this country, the Police protected the
      Indians and drove back the hungry thieving Sioux to their own land. And
      now a little bird has been telling me that this lying snake has been
      speaking into the ears of our Indian brothers and trying to persuade them
      to dig up the hatchet against their white brothers, their friends. The
      Police know all about this and laugh at it. The Police know about the
      foolish man at Batoche, the traitor Louis Riel. They know he is a liar and
      a coward. He leads brave men astray and then runs away and leaves them to
      suffer. This thing he did many years ago.&rdquo; And Cameron proceeded to give a
      brief sketch of the fantastic and futile rebellion of 1870 and of the
      ignoble part played by the vain and empty-headed Riel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of Cameron's words upon the Indians was an amazement even to
      himself. They forgot their breakfast and gathered close to the speaker,
      their eager faces and gleaming eyes showing how deeply stirred were their
      hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron was putting into his story an intensity of emotion and passion
      that not only surprised himself, but amazed his interpreter. Indeed so
      amazed was the little half-breed at Cameron's quite unusual display of
      oratorical power that his own imagination took fire and his own tongue was
      loosened to such an extent that by voice, look, tone and gesture he poured
      into his officer's harangue a force and fervor all his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued Cameron, &ldquo;this vain and foolish Frenchman seeks again
      to lead you astray, to lead you into war that will bring ruin to you and
      to your children; and this lying snake from your ancient enemies, the
      Sioux, thinking you are foolish children, seeks to make you fight against
      the great White Mother across the seas. He has been talking like a
      babbling old man, from whom the years have taken wisdom, when he says that
      the half-breeds and Indians can drive the white man from these plains. Has
      he told you how many are the children of the White Mother, how many are
      the soldiers in her army? Listen to me, and look! Get me many branches
      from the trees,&rdquo; he commanded sharply to some young Indians standing near.
    </p>
    <p>
      So completely were the Indians under the thrall of his speech that a dozen
      of them sprang at once to get branches from the poplar trees near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;how many are the White Mother's
      soldiers. See,&rdquo;&mdash;he held up both hands and then stuck up a small twig
      in the sand to indicate the number ten. Ten of these small twigs he set in
      a row and by a larger stick indicated a hundred, and so on till he had set
      forth in the sandy soil a diagrammatic representation of a hundred
      thousand men, the Indians following closely his every movement. &ldquo;And all
      these men,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;are armed with rifles and with great big guns
      that speak like thunder. And these are only a few of the White Mother's
      soldiers. How many Indians and half-breeds do you think there are with
      rifles?&rdquo; He set in a row sticks to represent a thousand men. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;so many.&rdquo; Then he added another similar row. &ldquo;Perhaps, if all the
      Indians gathered, so many with rifles. No more. Now look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no
      big guns, only a few bullets, a little powder, a little food. Ha, ha!&rdquo; he
      laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;The Sioux snake is a fool. His tongue must be
      stopped. My Indian brothers here will not listen to him, but there are
      others whose hearts are like the hearts of little children who may listen
      to his lying words. The Sioux snake must be caught and put in a cage, and
      this I do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered the words Cameron sprang for the Sioux, but quicker than his
      leap the Sioux darted through the crowding Indians who, perceiving
      Cameron's intent, thrust themselves in his path and enabled the Sioux to
      get away into the brush behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head him off, Jerry,&rdquo; yelled Cameron, whistling sharply at the same time
      for his men, while he darted for his horse and threw himself upon it. The
      whole camp was in a seething uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo; yelled Cameron, drawing his gun. The Indians fell away from him
      like waves from a speeding vessel. On the other side of the little bluff
      he caught sight of a mounted Indian flying toward the mountains and with a
      cry he started in pursuit. It took only a few minutes for Cameron to
      discover that he was gaining rapidly upon his man. But the rough rocky
      country was not far away in front of them, and here was abundant chance
      for hiding. Closer and closer he drew to his flying enemy&mdash;a hundred
      yards&mdash;seventy-five yards&mdash;fifty yards only separated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Cameron, &ldquo;or I shoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Indian, throwing himself on the far side of his pony, urged him to
      his topmost speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron steadied himself for a moment, took careful aim and fired. The
      flying pony stumbled, recovered himself, stumbled again and fell. But even
      before he reached the earth his rider had leaped free, and, still some
      thirty yards in advance, sped onward. Half a dozen strides and Cameron's
      horse was upon him, and, giving him the shoulder, hurled the Indian
      senseless to earth. In a flash Cameron was at his side, turned him over
      and discovered not the Sioux Chief but another Indian quite unknown to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rage and disappointment were almost beyond his control. For an instant
      he held his gun poised as if to strike, but the blow did not fall. His
      self command came back. He put up his gun, turned quickly away from the
      prostrate Indian, flung himself upon his horse and set off swiftly for the
      camp. It was but a mile distant, but in the brief time consumed in
      reaching it he had made up his mind as to his line of action. Unless his
      men had captured the Sioux it was almost certain that he had made his
      escape to the canyon, and once in the canyon there was little hope of his
      being taken. It was of the first importance that he should not appear too
      deeply concerned over his failure to take his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this thought in his mind Cameron loped easily into the Indian camp.
      He found the young braves in a state of feverish excitement. Armed with
      guns and clubs, they gathered about their Chiefs clamoring to be allowed
      to wipe out these representatives of the Police who had dared to attempt
      an arrest of this distinguished guest of theirs. As Cameron appeared the
      uproar quieted somewhat and the Indians gathered about him, eagerly
      waiting his next move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron cantered up to Running Stream and, looking round upon the crowding
      and excited braves, he said, with a smile of cool indifference:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sioux snake has slid away in the grass. He has missed his breakfast.
      My brother was about to eat. After he has eaten we will have some quiet
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he swung himself from his saddle, drew the reins over his
      horse's ears and, throwing himself down beside a camp fire, he pulled out
      his pipe and proceeded to light it as calmly as if sitting in a
      council-lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians were completely nonplussed. Nothing appeals more strongly to
      the Indian than an exhibition of steady nerve. For some moments they stood
      regarding Cameron with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration with a
      strong admixture of impatience, for they had thought of being done out of
      their great powwow with its attendant joys of dance and feast, and if this
      Policeman should choose to remain with them all day there could certainly
      be neither dancing nor feasting for them. In the meantime, however, there
      was nothing for it but to accept the situation created for them. This
      cool-headed Mounted Policeman had planted himself by their camp-fire. They
      could not very well drive him from their camp, nor could they converse
      with him till he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were thus standing about in uncertainty of mind and temper Jerry,
      the interpreter, came in and, with a grunt of recognition, threw himself
      down by Cameron beside the fire. After some further hesitation the Indians
      began to busy themselves once more with their breakfast. In the group
      about the campfire beside which Cameron had placed himself was the Chief,
      Running Stream. The presence of the Policeman beside his fire was most
      embarrassing to the Chief, for no man living has a keener sense of the
      obligations of hospitality than has the Indian. But the Indian hates to
      eat in the presence of a white man unless the white man shares his meal.
      Hence Running Stream approached Cameron with a courteous request that he
      would eat with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Running Stream, I have eaten, but I am sure Jerry here will be
      glad of some breakfast,&rdquo; said Cameron cordially, who had no desire
      whatever to dip out of the very doubtful mess in the pot which had been
      set down on the ground in the midst of the group around the fire. Jerry,
      however, had no scruples in the matter and, like every Indian and
      half-breed, was always ready for a meal. Having thus been offered
      hospitality and having by proxy accepted it, Cameron was in position to
      discuss with the Chief in a judicial if not friendly spirit the matter he
      had in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, Cameron offered his tobacco-pouch to the Chief, who,
      gravely helping himself to a pipeful, passed it on to his neighbor who,
      having done likewise, passed it in turn to the man next him till the
      tobacco was finished and the empty pouch returned with due gravity to the
      owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relations of friendly diplomacy being thus established, the whole party
      sat smoking in solemn silence until the pipes were smoked out. Then
      Cameron, knocking the ashes from his pipe, opened up the matter in hand,
      with Jerry interpreting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sioux snake,&rdquo; he began quietly, &ldquo;will be hungry for his breakfast.
      Honest men do not run away before breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Running Stream, non-committal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Police will get him in due time,&rdquo; continued Cameron in a tone of
      quiet indifference. &ldquo;He will cease to trouble our Indian brothers with
      foolish lies. The prison gates are strong and will soon close upon this
      stranger with the forked tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Chief grunted, still non-committal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a pity if any of your young men should give heed to these
      silly tales. None of your wise men have done so. In the Sioux country
      there is frequent war between the soldiers and the Indians because bad men
      wish to wrong the Indians and the Indians grow angry and fight, but in
      this country white men are punished who do wrong to Indians. This Running
      Stream knows to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Running Stream acquiescing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Indians do wrong to white men it is just that the Indians should be
      punished as well. The Police do justly between the white man and the
      Indian. My brother knows this to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; again grunted Running Stream with an uneasy look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore when young and foolish braves steal and kill cattle they must
      be punished. They must be taught to keep the law.&rdquo; Here Cameron's voice
      grew gentle as a child's, but there was in its tone something that made
      the Chief glance quickly at his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, my young men no steal cattle,&rdquo; he said sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? I am glad to hear that. I believe that is true, and that is why I
      smoke with my brother beside his camp fire. But some young men in this
      band have stolen cattle, and I want my brother to find them that I might
      take them with me to the Commissioner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know any Indian take cattle,&rdquo; said Running Stream in surly defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are four skins and four heads lying in the bluff up yonder, Running
      Stream. I am going to take those with me to the Commissioner and I am sure
      he would like to see you about those skins.&rdquo; Cameron's manner continued to
      be mild but there ran through his speech an undertone of stern resolution
      that made the Indian squirm a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know any Indian take cattle,&rdquo; repeated Running Stream, but with less
      defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it would be well for my brother to find out the thieves, for,&rdquo; and
      here Cameron paused and looked the Chief steadily in the face for a few
      moments, &ldquo;for we are to take them back with us or we will ask the Chief to
      come and explain to the Commissioner why he does not know what his young
      men are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Blackfeet Indian take cattle,&rdquo; said the Chief once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Then it must be the Bloods, or the Piegans or the
      Stonies. We will call their Chiefs together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no hurry in Cameron's manner. He had determined to spend the day
      if necessary in running down these thieves. At his suggestion Running
      Stream called together the Chiefs of the various bands of Indians
      represented. From his supplies Cameron drew forth some more tobacco and,
      passing it round the circle of Chiefs, calmly waited until all had smoked
      their pipes out, after which he proceeded to lay the case before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brothers are not thieves. The Police believe them to be honest men,
      but unfortunately among them there have crept in some who are not honest.
      In the bluff yonder are four hides and four heads of steers, two of them
      from my own herd. Some bad Indians have stolen and killed these steers and
      they are here in this camp to-day, and I am going to take them with me to
      the Commissioner. Running Stream is a great Chief and speaks no lies and
      he tells me that none of his young men have taken these cattle. Will the
      Chief of the Stonies, the Chief of the Bloods, the Chief of the Piegans
      say the same for their young men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Stonies take no cattle,&rdquo; answered an Indian whom Cameron recognized
      as the leading representative of that tribe present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many Stonies here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian held up six fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, only six. What about the Bloods and the Piegans?&rdquo; demanded Cameron.
      &ldquo;It is not for me,&rdquo; he continued, when there was no reply, &ldquo;to discover
      the cattle-thieves. It is for the Big Chief of this camp, it is for you,
      Running Stream, and when you have found the thieves I shall arrest them
      and bring them to the Commissioner, for I will not return without them.
      Meantime I go to bring here the skins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Cameron rode leisurely away, leaving Jerry to keep an eye upon
      the camp. For more than an hour they talked among themselves, but without
      result. Finally they came to Jerry, who, during his years with the Police,
      had to a singular degree gained the confidence of the Indians. But Jerry
      gave them little help. There had been much stealing of cattle by some of
      the tribes, not by all. The Police had been patient, but they had become
      weary. They had their suspicions as to the thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Feather was anxious to know what Indians were suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the Stonies and not the Blackfeet,&rdquo; replied Jerry quietly. It was a
      pity, he continued, that innocent men should suffer for the guilty. He
      knew Running Stream was no thief, but Running Stream must find out the
      thieves in the band under his control. How would Running Stream like to
      have the great Chief of the Blackfeet, Crowfoot, know that he could not
      control the young men under his command and did not know what they were
      doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion of Jerry had a mighty effect upon the Blackfeet Chief, for
      old Crowfoot was indeed a great Chief and a mighty power with his band,
      and to fall into disfavor with him would be a serious matter for any
      junior Chief in the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they withdrew for further discussion and soon it became evident that
      Jerry's cunning suggestions had sown seeds of discord among them. The
      dispute waxed hot and fierce, not as to the guilty parties, who were
      apparently acknowledged to be the Piegans, but as to the course to be
      pursued. Running Stream had no intention that his people and himself
      should become involved in the consequences of the crimes of other tribes
      whom the Blackfeet counted their inferiors. Eagle Feather and his Piegans
      must bear the consequences of their own misdeeds. On the other hand Eagle
      Feather pleaded hard that they should stand together in this matter, that
      the guilty parties could not be disclosed. The Police could not punish
      them all, and all the more necessary was it that they should hold together
      because of the larger enterprise into which they were about to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of the Sioux Chief Onawata, however, weakened the bond of
      unity which he more than any other had created and damped the ardor of the
      less eager of the conspirators. It was likewise a serious blow to their
      hopes of success that the Police knew all their plans. Running Stream
      finally gave forth his decision, which was that the thieves should be
      given up, and that they all should join in a humble petition to the Police
      for leniency, pleading the necessity of hunger on their hunting-trip, and,
      as for the larger enterprise, that they should apparently abandon it until
      suspicion had been allayed and until the plans of their brothers in the
      North were more nearly matured. The time for striking had not yet come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this decision all but the Piegans agreed. In vain Eagle Feather
      contended that they should stand together and defy the Police to prove any
      of them guilty. In vain he sought to point out that if in this crisis they
      surrendered the Piegans to the Police never again could they count upon
      the Piegans to support them in any enterprise. But Running Stream and the
      others were resolved. The thieves must be given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment in which this decision had been reached Cameron rode
      in, carrying with him the incriminating hides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Jerry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You take charge of these and bring them to the
      Commissioner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jerry, taking the hides from Cameron's horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is up, Jerry?&rdquo; said Cameron in a low voice as the half-breed was
      untying the bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beeg row,&rdquo; whispered Jerry. &ldquo;Eagle Feather t'ief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, keep close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quietly Cameron walked over to the group of excited Indians. As he
      approached they opened their circle to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother has discovered the thief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And after all a thief is
      easily found among honest men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and deliberately his eye traveled round the circle of faces, keenly
      scrutinizing each in turn. When he came to Eagle Feather he paused, gazed
      fixedly at him, took a single step in his direction, and, suddenly
      leveling an accusing finger at him, cried in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found him. This man is the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he walked up to the Indian, who remained stoically motionless, laid
      his hand upon his wrist and said in a clear ringing voice heard over the
      encampment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eagle Feather, I arrest you in the name of the Queen!&rdquo; And before another
      word could be spoken or a movement made Eagle Feather stood handcuffed, a
      prisoner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;GOOD MAN&mdash;GOOD SQUAW&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy is worse, Mrs. Cameron, decidedly worse, and I wash my hands of
      all responsibility.&rdquo; The old army surgeon was clearly annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandy sat silent, weary with watching and weary with the conflict that had
      gone on intermittently during the past three days. The doctor was
      determined to have the gangrenous foot off. That was the simplest solution
      of the problem before him and the foot would have come off days ago if he
      had had his way. But the Indian boy had vehemently opposed this proposal.
      &ldquo;One foot&mdash;me go die,&rdquo; was his ultimatum, and through all the fever
      and delirium this was his continuous refrain. In this determination his
      nurse supported him, for she could not bring herself to the conviction
      that amputation was absolutely necessary, and, besides, of all the
      melancholy and useless driftwood that drives hither and thither with the
      ebb and flow of human life, she could imagine none more melancholy and
      more useless than an Indian crippled of a foot. Hence she supported the
      boy in his ultimatum, &ldquo;One foot&mdash;me go die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That foot ought to come off,&rdquo; repeated the doctor, beginning the
      controversy anew. &ldquo;Otherwise the boy will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, doctor,&rdquo; said Mandy wearily, &ldquo;just think how pitiable, how helpless
      that boy will be. Death is better. And, besides, I have not quite given up
      hope that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor snorted his contempt for her opinion; and only his respect for
      her as Cameron's wife and for the truly extraordinary powers and gifts in
      her profession which she had displayed during the past three days held
      back the wrathful words that were at his lips. It was late in the
      afternoon and the doctor had given many hours to this case, riding back
      and forward from the fort every day, but all this he would not have
      grudged could he have had his way with his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have done my best,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now I must go back to my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, doctor, I know,&rdquo; pleaded Mandy. &ldquo;You have been most kind and I
      thank you from my heart.&rdquo; She rose and offered him her hand. &ldquo;Don't think
      me too awfully obstinate, and please forgive me if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took the outstretched hand grudgingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obstinate!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Of all the obstinate creatures&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am afraid I am. But I don't want to be unreasonable. You see, the
      boy is so splendidly plucky and such a fine chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine chap, doctor, and I can't bear to have him crippled, and&mdash;&rdquo;
       She paused abruptly, her lips beginning to quiver. She was near the limit
      of her endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would rather have him dead, eh? All right, if that suits you better
      it makes no difference to me,&rdquo; said the doctor gruffly, picking up his
      bag. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, you will come back again to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? Why should I come back to-morrow? I can do no more&mdash;unless
      you agree to amputation. There is no use coming back to-morrow. I have
      other cases waiting on me. I can't give all my time to this Indian.&rdquo; The
      contempt in the doctor's voice for a mere Indian stung her like a whip. On
      Mandy's cheek, pale with her long vigil, a red flush appeared and in her
      eye a light that would have warned the doctor had he known her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not this Indian a human being?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor was very impatient and anxious to be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A human being? Yes, of course, a human being, but there are human beings
      and human beings. But if you mean an Indian is as good as a white man,
      frankly I don't agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given a great deal of your time, doctor,&rdquo; said Mandy with quiet
      deliberation, &ldquo;and I am most grateful. I can ask no more for THIS INDIAN.
      I only regret that I have been forced to ask so much of your time.
      Good-by.&rdquo; There was a ring as of steel in her voice. The doctor became at
      once apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;eh?&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not at all necessary. Thank you again for all your service.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? I don't quite&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, doctor, and again thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know quite well I can't do any more,&rdquo; said the old doctor
      crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what? Well, good-by.&rdquo; And awkwardly the doctor walked away,
      rather uncertain as to her meaning but with a feeling that he had been
      dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most impossible person!&rdquo; he muttered as he left the tent door, indignant
      with himself that no fitting reply would come to his lips. And not until
      he had mounted his horse and taken the trail was he able to give full and
      adequate expression to his feelings, and even then it took him some
      considerable time to do full justice to himself and to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the nurse had turned back to her watch, weary and despairing. In
      a way that she could not herself understand the Indian boy had awakened
      her interest and even her affection. His fine stoical courage, his warm
      and impulsive gratitude excited her admiration and touched her heart.
      Again arose to her lips a cry that had been like a refrain in her heart
      for the past three days, &ldquo;Oh, if only Dr. Martin were here!&rdquo; Her
      experience and training under Dr. Martin had made it only too apparent
      that the old army surgeon was archaic in his practice and method.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something could be done!&rdquo; she said aloud, as she bent over her
      patient. &ldquo;If only Dr. Martin were here! Poor boy! Oh! I wish he were
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to her cry there was outside a sound of galloping horses.
      She ran to the tent door and before her astonished eyes there drew up at
      her tent Dr. Martin, her sister-in-law and the ever-faithful Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, Dr. Martin!&rdquo; she cried, running to him with both hands
      outstretched, and could say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, what's up? Say, what the deuce have they been doing to you?&rdquo; The
      doctor was quite wrathful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am glad, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad? Well, you show your joy in a mighty queer way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's done out, Doctor,&rdquo; cried Moira, springing from her horse and
      running to her sister-in-law. &ldquo;I ought to have come before to relieve
      her,&rdquo; she continued penitently, with her arms round Mandy, &ldquo;but I knew so
      little, and besides I thought the doctor was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was here,&rdquo; said Mandy, recovering herself. &ldquo;He has just gone, and oh,
      I am glad. He wanted to cut his foot off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut his foot off? Whose foot off? His own?&rdquo; said Dr. Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am glad! How did you get here in all the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your telegram came when I was away,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I did not get it
      for a day, then I came at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your telegram. I have it here&mdash;no, I've left it somewhere&mdash;but
      I certainly got a telegram from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me? I never sent a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Cameron. I understood you to desire Dr. Martin's
      presence, and&mdash;I ventured to send a wire in your name. I hope you
      will forgive the liberty,&rdquo; said Smith, red to his hair-roots and looking
      over his horse's neck with a most apologetic air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive the liberty?&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;Why, bless you, Mr. Smith, you are my
      guardian angel,&rdquo; running to him and shaking him warmly by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he brought, us here, too,&rdquo; cried Moira. &ldquo;He has been awfully good to
      me these days. I do not know what I should have done without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Smith was standing first on one foot and then on the other in a
      most unhappy state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I will be going back,&rdquo; he said in an agony of awkwardness and
      confusion. &ldquo;It is getting kind of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Going right away?&rdquo; exclaimed Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got some chores to look after, and I guess none of you are coming
      back now anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hold on a bit,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;We'll see what's doing inside.
      Let's get the lie of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you don't need me any more,&rdquo; continued Smith. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo; And he
      climbed on to his horse. &ldquo;I have got to get back. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one appeared to have any good reason why Smith should remain, and so he
      rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; called out Mandy impulsively. &ldquo;You have really saved
      my life, I assure you. I was in utter despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; cried Moira, waving her hand with a bright smile.
      &ldquo;You have saved me too from dying many a time these three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an awkward wave Smith answered these farewells and rode down the
      trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is really a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;Always doing something for
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just it,&rdquo; cried Moira. &ldquo;He has spent his whole time these three
      days doing things for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no wonder,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;A most useful chap. But what's the
      trouble here? Let's get at the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mandy gave him a detailed history of the case, the doctor meanwhile making
      an examination of the patient's general condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the doctor would have his foot off, but I would not stand for that,&rdquo;
       cried Mandy indignantly as she closed her history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! Looks bad enough to come off, I should say. I wish I had been here a
      couple of days ago. It may have to come off all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Martin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not just to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don't know what the outcome may be, but it
      looks as bad as it well can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; cried Mandy cheerfully. Her burden of
      responsibility was lifted. Her care was gone. &ldquo;I knew it would be all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whether it will or not I cannot say. But one thing I do know,
      you've got to trot off to sleep. Show me the ropes and then off you go.
      Who runs this camp anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Chief does, Chief Trotting Wolf. I will call him,&rdquo; cried Mandy.
      &ldquo;He has been very good to me. I will get him.&rdquo; And she ran from the tent
      to find the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she wonderful?&rdquo; said Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful? I should say so. But she is played right out I can see,&rdquo;
       replied the doctor. &ldquo;I must get comfortable quarters for you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you not want some one?&rdquo; said Moira. &ldquo;Do you not want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I want you?&rdquo; echoed the doctor, looking at her as she stood in the
      glow of the westering sun shining through the canvas tent. &ldquo;Do I want
      you?&rdquo; he repeated with deliberate emphasis. &ldquo;Well, you can just bet that
      is just what I do want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight flush appeared on the girl's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;cannot I be of some help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, most certainly,&rdquo; said the doctor, noting the flush. &ldquo;Your
      help will be invaluable after a bit. But first you must get Mrs. Cameron
      to sleep. She has been on this job, I understand, for three days. She is
      quite played out. And you, too, need sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am quite fit. I do not need sleep. I am quite ready to take my
      sister-in-law's place, that is, as far as I can. And you will surely need
      some one&mdash;to help you I mean.&rdquo; The doctor's eyes were upon her face.
      Under his gaze her voice faltered. The glow of the sunset through the tent
      walls illumined her face with a wonderful radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Moira,&rdquo; said the doctor with abrupt vehemence, &ldquo;I wish I had the
      nerve to tell you just how much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried the girl, her glowing face suddenly pale, &ldquo;they are coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the Chief, Dr. Martin,&rdquo; cried Mandy, ushering in that stately
      individual. The doctor saluted the Chief in due form and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could we have another tent, Chief, for these ladies? Just beside this
      tent here, so that they can have a little sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief grunted a doubtful acquiescence, but in due time a tent very
      much dilapidated was pitched upon the clean dry ground close beside that
      in which the sick boy lay. While this was being done the doctor was making
      a further examination of his patient. With admiring eyes, Moira followed
      the swift movements of his deft fingers. There was no hesitation. There
      was no fumbling. There was the sure indication of accurate knowledge, the
      obvious self-confidence of experience in everything he did. Even to her
      untutored eyes the doctor seemed to be walking with a very firm tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after an hour's work, he turned to Mandy who was assisting him
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you can both go to sleep. I shall need you no more till morning. I
      shall keep an eye on him. Off you go. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be sure to call me if I can be of service,&rdquo; said Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do no such thing. I expect you to sleep. I shall look after this
      end of the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very sure of himself, is he not?&rdquo; said Moira in a low tone to her
      sister-in-law as they passed out of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a right to be,&rdquo; said Mandy proudly. &ldquo;He knows his work, and now I
      feel as if I can sleep in peace. What a blessed thing sleep is,&rdquo; she
      added, as, without undressing, she tumbled on to the couch prepared for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dr. Martin very clever? I mean, is he an educated man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;Dr. Martin what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he very clever? Is he&mdash;an educated man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; she repeated, yawning desperately. &ldquo;Oh, I was asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever? Well, rather&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice was trailing off again into
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is he an educated man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Educated? Knows his work if that's what you mean. Oh-h&mdash;but I'm
      sleepy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo; Mandy sat up straight. &ldquo;A gentleman? I should say so! That is,
      he is a man all through right to his toe-tips. And gentle&mdash;more
      gentle than any woman I ever saw. Will that do? Good-night.&rdquo; And before
      Moira could make reply she was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the night was over the opportunity was given the doctor to prove
      his manhood, and in a truly spectacular manner. For shortly after midnight
      Moira found herself sitting bolt upright, wide-awake and clutching her
      sister-in-law in wild terror. Outside their tent the night was hideous
      with discordant noises, yells, whoops, cries, mingled with the beating of
      tom-toms. Terrified and trembling, the two girls sprang to the door, and,
      lifting the flap, peered out. It was the party of braves returning from
      the great powwow so rudely interrupted by Cameron. They were returning in
      an evil mood, too, for they were enraged at the arrest of Eagle Feather
      and three accomplices in his crime, disappointed in the interruption of
      their sun dance and its attendant joys of feast and song, and furious at
      what appeared to them to be the overthrow of the great adventure for which
      they had been preparing and planning for the past two months. This was
      indeed the chief cause of their rage, for it seemed as if all further
      attempts at united effort among the Western tribes had been frustrated by
      the discovery of their plans, by the flight of their leader, and by the
      treachery of the Blackfeet Chief, Running Stream, in surrendering their
      fellow-tribesmen to the Police. To them that treachery rendered impossible
      any coalition between the Piegans and the Blackfeet. Furthermore, before
      their powwow had been broken up there had been distributed among them a
      few bottles of whisky provided beforehand by the astute Sioux as a
      stimulus to their enthusiasm against a moment of crisis when such stimulus
      should be necessary. These bottles, in the absence of their great leader,
      were distributed among the tribes by Running Stream as a peace-offering,
      but for obvious reason not until the moment came for their parting from
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled with rage and disappointment, and maddened with the bad whisky they
      had taken, they poured into the encampment with wild shouting accompanied
      by the discharge of guns and the beating of drums. In terror the girls
      clung to each other, gazing out upon the horrid scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is this, Mandy?&rdquo; cried Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her sister-in-law could give her little explanation. The moonlight,
      glowing bright as day, revealed a truly terrifying spectacle. A band of
      Indians, almost naked and hideously painted, were leaping, shouting,
      beating drums and firing guns. Out from the tents poured the rest of the
      band to meet them, eagerly inquiring into the cause of their excitement.
      Soon fires were lighted and kettles put on, for the Indian's happiness is
      never complete unless associated with feasting, and the whole band
      prepared itself for a time of revelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girls stood peering out upon this terrible scene they became aware
      of the doctor standing at their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, they seem to be cutting up rather rough, don't they?&rdquo; he said
      coolly. &ldquo;I think as a precautionary measure you had better step over into
      the other tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hastily gathering their belongings, they ran across with the doctor to his
      tent, from which they continued to gaze upon the weird spectacle before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the largest fire in the center of the camp the crowd gathered, Chief
      Trotting Wolf in the midst, and were harangued by one of the returning
      braves who was evidently reciting the story of their experiences and whose
      tale was received with the deepest interest and was punctuated by mad
      cries and whoops. The one English word that could be heard was the word
      &ldquo;Police,&rdquo; and it needed no interpreter to explain to the watchers that the
      chief object of fury to the crowding, gesticulating Indians about the fire
      was the Policeman who had been the cause of their humiliation and
      disappointment. In a pause of the uproar a loud exclamation from an Indian
      arrested the attention of the band. Once more he uttered his exclamation
      and pointed to the tent lately occupied by the ladies. Quickly the whole
      band about the fire appeared to bunch together preparatory to rush in the
      direction indicated, but before they could spring forward Trotting Wolf,
      speaking rapidly and with violent gesticulation, stood in their path. But
      his voice was unheeded. He was thrust aside and the whole band came
      rushing madly toward the tent lately occupied by the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get back from the door,&rdquo; said the doctor, speaking rapidly. &ldquo;These chaps
      seem to be somewhat excited. I wish I had my gun,&rdquo; he continued, looking
      about the tent for a weapon of some sort. &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; he said, picking
      up a stout poplar pole that had been used for driving the tent pegs. &ldquo;Stay
      inside here. Don't move till I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will kill you,&rdquo; cried Moira, laying her hand upon his arm. &ldquo;You
      must not go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the doctor almost roughly. &ldquo;Kill me? Not much. I'll knock
      some of their blocks off first.&rdquo; So saying, he lifted the flap of the tent
      and passed out just as the rush of maddened Indians came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the ladies' tent they fell, kicked the tent poles down, and, seizing
      the canvas ripped it clear from its pegs. Some moments they spent
      searching the empty bed, then turned with renewed cries toward the other
      tent before which stood the doctor, waiting, grim, silent, savage. For a
      single moment they paused, arrested by the silent figure, then with a
      whoop a drink-maddened brave sprang toward the tent, his rifle clubbed to
      strike. Before he could deliver his blow the doctor, stepping swiftly to
      one side, swung his poplar club hard upon the uplifted arms, sent the
      rifle crashing to the ground and with a backward swing caught the
      astonished brave on the exposed head and dropped him to the earth as if
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that, you dog!&rdquo; he cried savagely. &ldquo;Come on, who's next?&rdquo; he
      shouted, swinging his club as a player might a baseball bat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the next rush, however, help came in an unexpected form. The tent
      flap was pushed back and at the doctor's side stood an apparition that
      checked the Indians' advance and stilled their cries. It was the Indian
      boy, clad in a white night robe of Mandy's providing, his rifle in his
      hand, his face ghastly in the moonlight and his eyes burning like flames
      of light. One cry he uttered, weird, fierce, unearthly, but it seemed to
      pierce like a knife through the stillness that had fallen. Awed, sobered,
      paralyzed, the Indians stood motionless. Then from their ranks ran Chief
      Trotting Wolf, picked up the rifle of the Indian who still lay insensible
      on the ground, and took his place beside the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words he spoke in a voice that rang out fiercely imperious. Still
      the Indians stood motionless. Again the Chief spoke in short, sharp words
      of command, and, as they still hesitated, took one swift stride toward the
      man that stood nearest, swinging his rifle over his head. Forward sprang
      the doctor to his side, his poplar club likewise swung up to strike. Back
      fell the Indians a pace or two, the Chief following them with a torrential
      flow of vehement invective. Slowly, sullenly the crowd gave back, cowed
      but still wrathful, and beginning to mutter in angry undertones. Once more
      the tent flap was pushed aside and there issued two figures who ran to the
      side of the Indian boy, now swaying weakly upon his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy!&rdquo; cried Mandy, throwing her arms round about him, and,
      steadying him as he let his rifle fall, let him sink slowly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cowards!&rdquo; cried Moira, seizing the rifle that the boy had dropped and
      springing to the doctor's side. &ldquo;Look at what you have done!&rdquo; She turned
      and pointed indignantly to the swooning boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an exclamation of wrath the doctor stepped back to Mandy's aid,
      forgetful of the threatening Indians and mindful only of his patient.
      Quickly he sprang into the tent, returning with a stimulating remedy, bent
      over the boy and worked with him till he came back again to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the Chief, who with the Indians had been gazing upon this scene,
      turned and spoke to his band, this time in tones of quiet dignity,
      pointing to the little group behind him. Silent and subdued the Indians
      listened, their quick impulses like those of children stirred to sympathy
      for the lad and for those who would aid him. Gradually the crowd drew off,
      separating into groups and gathering about the various fires. For the time
      the danger was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them Dr. Martin and the Chief carried the boy into the tent and
      laid him on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of beasts have you got out there anyway?&rdquo; said the doctor,
      facing the Chief abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him drink bad whisky,&rdquo; answered the Chief, tipping up his hand. &ldquo;Him
      crazee,&rdquo; touching his head with his forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crazy! Well, I should say. What they want is a few ounces of lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief made no reply, but stood with his eyes turned admiringly upon
      Moira's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squaw&mdash;him good,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the girl. &ldquo;No 'fraid&mdash;much
      brave&mdash;good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right enough there, Chief,&rdquo; replied the doctor heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him you squaw?&rdquo; inquired the Chief, pointing to Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;eh? No, not exactly,&rdquo; replied the doctor, much confused, &ldquo;that
      is&mdash;not yet I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Him good squaw. Him good man,&rdquo; replied the Chief, pointing first to
      Moira, then to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moira hurried to the tent door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all gone,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Thank God! How awful they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; replied the Chief, moving out past her. &ldquo;Him drink, him crazee&mdash;no
      drink, no crazee.&rdquo; At the door he paused, and, looking back, said once
      more with increased emphasis, &ldquo;Huh! Him good squaw,&rdquo; and finally
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said the doctor with a delighted chuckle. &ldquo;The old boy is a man
      of some discernment I can see. But the kid and you saved the day, Miss
      Moira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what nonsense you are talking. It was truly awful, and how splendidly
      you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I caught him rather a neat one, I confess. I wonder if the brute is
      sleeping yet. But you did the trick finally, Miss Moira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Mandy derisively, &ldquo;Good man&mdash;good squaw, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE OUTLAW
    </h3>
    <p>
      The bitter weather following an autumn of unusual mildness had set in with
      the New Year and had continued without a break for fifteen days. A heavy
      fall of snow with a blizzard blowing sixty miles an hour had made the
      trails almost impassable, indeed quite so to any but to those bent on
      desperate business or to Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police. To these
      gallant riders all trails stood open at all seasons of the year, no matter
      what snow might fall or blizzard blow, so long as duty called them forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail from the fort to the Big Horn Ranch, however, was so wind-swept
      that the snow was blown away, which made the going fairly easy, and the
      Superintendent, Inspector Dickson and Jerry trotted along freely enough in
      the face of a keen southwester that cut to the bone. It was surely some
      desperate business indeed that sent them out into the face of that cutting
      wind which made even these hardy riders, burned hard and dry by scorching
      suns and biting blizzards, wince and shelter their faces with their
      gauntleted hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuce of a wind, this!&rdquo; said the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the raw southwester that gets to the bone,&rdquo; replied Inspector
      Dickson. &ldquo;This will blow up a chinook before night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he has got into shelter,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;This has
      been an unusually hard fortnight, and I am afraid he went rather light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's sure to be all right,&rdquo; replied the Inspector quickly. &ldquo;He was
      riding, but he took his snowshoes with him for timber work. He's hardly
      the man to get caught and he won't quit easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he won't quit, but there are times when human endurance fails. Not
      that I fear anything like that for Cameron,&rdquo; added the Superintendent
      hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's not the man to fall down,&rdquo; replied the Inspector. &ldquo;He goes the
      limit, but he keeps his head. He's no reckless fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ought to know him,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;You have been
      through some things together, but this last week has been about the worst
      that I have known. This fortnight will be remembered in the annals of this
      country. And it came so unexpectedly. What do you think about it, Jerry?&rdquo;
       continued the Superintendent, turning to the half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He good man&mdash;cold ver' bad&mdash;ver' long. S'pose catch heem on
      plains&mdash;ver' bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector touched his horse to a canter. The vision that floated
      before his mind's eye while the half-breed was speaking he hated to
      contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's all right. He has come through too many tight places to fail here,&rdquo;
       said the Inspector in a tone almost of defiance, and refused to talk
      further upon the subject. But he kept urging the pace till they drew up at
      the stables of the Big Horn Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector's first glance upon opening the stable door swept the stall
      where Ginger was wont to conduct his melancholy ruminations. It gave him a
      start to see the stall empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Smith!&rdquo; he cried as that individual appeared with a bundle of hay
      from the stack in the yard outside. &ldquo;Boss home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Cameron returned?&rdquo; inquired the Superintendent in the same
      breath, and in spite of himself a note of anxiety had crept into his
      voice. The three men stood waiting, their tense attitude expressing the
      anxiety they would not put into words. The deliberate Smith, who had
      transferred his services from old Thatcher to Cameron and who had taken
      the ranch and all persons and things belonging to it into his immediate
      charge, disposed of his bundle in a stall, and then facing them said
      slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess he's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he home?&rdquo; asked the Inspector sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's home all right. Gone to bed, I think,&rdquo; answered Smith with
      maddening calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector cursed him between his teeth and turned away from the others
      till his eyes should be clear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will just look in on Mrs. Cameron for a few minutes,&rdquo; said the
      Superintendent. &ldquo;We won't disturb him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Jerry to put up their horses, they went into the ranch-house and
      found the ladies in a state of suppressed excitement. Mandy met them at
      the door with an eager welcome, holding out to them trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad you have come!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It was all I could do to
      hold him back from going to you even as he was. He was quite set on going
      and only lay down on promise that I should wake him in an hour. Sit down
      here by the fire. An hour, mind you,&rdquo; she continued, talking rapidly and
      under obvious excitement, &ldquo;and him so blind and exhausted that&mdash;&rdquo; She
      paused abruptly, unable to command her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to sleep twelve hours straight,&rdquo; said the Superintendent with
      emphasis, &ldquo;and twenty-four would be better, with suitable breaks for
      refreshment,&rdquo; he added in a lighter tone, glancing at Mandy's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for he has had little enough to eat the last
      three days. And that reminds me&mdash;&rdquo; she hurried to the pantry and
      returned with the teapot&mdash;&ldquo;you must be cold, Superintendent. Ah, this
      terrible cold! A hot cup of tea will be just the thing. It will take only
      five minutes&mdash;and it is better than punch, though perhaps you men do
      not think so.&rdquo; She laughed somewhat wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said the Superintendent in a shocked, bantering
      voice, &ldquo;how can you imagine we should be guilty of such heresy&mdash;in
      this prohibition country, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you men,&rdquo; replied Mandy. &ldquo;We keep some Scotch in the house&mdash;beside
      the laudanum. Some people can't take tea, you know,&rdquo; she added with an
      uncertain smile, struggling to regain control of herself. &ldquo;But all the
      same, I am a nurse, and I know that after exposure tea is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent, &ldquo;I bow to your experience,&rdquo; making
      a brave attempt to meet her mood and declining to note her unusual
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the specified five minutes the tea was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could quite accept your tea-drinking theory, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said
      Inspector Dickson, &ldquo;if&mdash;if, mark you&mdash;I should always get such
      tea as this. But I don't believe Jerry here would agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry, who had just entered, stood waiting explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cameron has just been upholding the virtue of a good cup of tea,
      Jerry, over a hot Scotch after a cold ride. Now what's your unbiased
      opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight grin wrinkled the cracks in Jerry's leather-skin face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot whisky&mdash;good for fun&mdash;for cold no good. Whisky good for
      sleep&mdash;for long trail no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Jerry,&rdquo; cried Mandy enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right, Jerry,&rdquo; said the Inspector, joining in the general
      laugh that followed, &ldquo;but I don't think Miss Moira here would agree with
      you in regard to the merits of her national beverage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not so sure,&rdquo; cried the young lady, entering into the mood of
      the others. &ldquo;Of course, I am Scotch and naturally stand up for my country
      and for its customs, but, to be strictly honest, I remember hearing my
      brother say that Scotch was bad training for football.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good again!&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;You see, when anything serious is on, the
      wisest people cut out the Scotch, as the boys say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, becoming
      grave. &ldquo;On the long trail and in the bitter cold we drop the Scotch and
      bank on tea. As for whisky, the Lord knows it gives the Police enough
      trouble in this country. If it were not for the whisky half our work would
      be cut out. But tell me, how is Mr. Cameron?&rdquo; he added, as he handed back
      his cup for another supply of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done up, or more nearly done up than ever I have seen him, or than I ever
      want to see him again.&rdquo; Mandy paused abruptly, handed him his cup of tea,
      passed into the pantry and for some moments did not appear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was terrible to see him,&rdquo; said Moira, clasping her hands and
      speaking in an eager, excited voice. &ldquo;He came, poor boy, stumbling toward
      the door. He had to leave his horse, you know, some miles away. Through
      the window we saw him coming along&mdash;and we did not know him&mdash;he
      staggered as if&mdash;as if&mdash;actually as if he were drunk.&rdquo; Her laugh
      was almost hysterical. &ldquo;And he could not find the latch&mdash;and when we
      opened the door his eyes were&mdash;oh!&mdash;so terrible!&mdash;wild&mdash;and
      bloodshot&mdash;and blind! Oh, I cannot tell you about it!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      her voice breaking and her tears falling fast. &ldquo;And he could hardly speak
      to us. We had to cut off his snow-shoes&mdash;and his gauntlets and his
      clothes were like iron. He could not sit down&mdash;he just&mdash;just&mdash;lay
      on the floor&mdash;till&mdash;my sister&mdash;&rdquo; Here the girl's sobs
      interrupted her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; cried the Superintendent. &ldquo;What a mercy he reached home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector had risen and came round to Moira's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to tell me any more,&rdquo; he said in a husky voice, patting her
      gently on the shoulder. &ldquo;He is here with us, safe, poor chap. My God!&rdquo; he
      cried in an undertone, &ldquo;what he must have gone through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Mandy returned and took her place again quietly by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this sudden spell of cold that nearly killed him,&rdquo; she said in a
      quiet voice. &ldquo;He was not fully prepared for it, and it caught him at the
      end of his trip, too, when he was nearly played out. You see, he was five
      weeks away and he had only expected to be three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unexpected emergency seems to have arisen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what it was,&rdquo; replied Mandy. &ldquo;He could tell me little, but
      he was determined to go on to the fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something about his plans,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;He had proposed a
      tour of the reserves, beginning with the Piegans and ending with the
      Bloods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we know something of his work, too, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; said the
      Superintendent. &ldquo;Superintendent Strong has sent us a very fine report
      indeed of your husband's work. We do not talk about these things, you
      know, in the Police, but we can appreciate them all the same.
      Superintendent Strong's letter is one you would like to keep. I shall send
      it to you. Knowing Superintendent Strong as I do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him too,&rdquo; said Mandy with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you will be able to appreciate all the more any word of
      commendation he would utter. He practically attributes the present state
      of quiet and the apparent collapse of this conspiracy business to your
      husband's efforts. This, of course, is no compensation for his sufferings
      or yours, but I think it right that you should know the facts.&rdquo; The
      Superintendent had risen to his feet and had delivered his little speech
      in his very finest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mandy simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had expected him back a week ago,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;We know he
      must have had some serious cause for delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know about that,&rdquo; replied Mandy, &ldquo;but I do know he was most
      anxious to go on to the fort. He had some information to give, he said,
      which was of the first importance. And I am glad you are here. He will be
      saved that trip, which would really be dangerous in his present condition.
      And I don't believe I could have stopped him, but I should have gone with
      him. His hour will soon be up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think of waking him,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;We can wait two
      hours, or three hours, or more if necessary. Let him sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would waken himself if he were not so fearfully done up. He has a
      trick of waking at any hour he sets,&rdquo; said Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Cameron justified her remarks by appearing from the
      inner room. The men, accustomed as they were to the ravages of the winter
      trail upon their comrades, started to their feet in horror. Blindly
      Cameron felt his way to them, shading his blood-shot eyes from the light.
      His face was blistered and peeled as if he had come through a fire, his
      lips swollen and distorted, his hands trembling and showing on every
      finger the marks of frost bite, and his feet dragging as he shuffled
      across the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, my dear fellow,&rdquo; cried the Inspector, springing up to
      meet him and grasping him by both arms to lead him to a chair. &ldquo;You ran it
      too close that time. Here is the Superintendent to lecture you. Sit down,
      old man, sit down right here.&rdquo; The Inspector deposited him in the chair,
      and, striding hurriedly to the window, stood there looking out upon the
      bleak winter snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Cameron,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, shaking him by the hand with
      hearty cheerfulness. &ldquo;Glad, awfully glad to see you. Fine bit of work,
      very fine bit of work. Very complimentary report about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you refer to, sir,&rdquo; said Cameron, speaking thickly,
      &ldquo;but I am glad you are here, for I have an important communication to
      make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;Don't worry about that.
      And take your own time. First of all, how are you feeling? Snow-blind, I
      see,&rdquo; he continued, critically examining him, &ldquo;and generally used up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather knocked up,&rdquo; replied Cameron, his tongue refusing to move with its
      accustomed ease. &ldquo;But shall be fit in a day or two. Beastly sleepy, but
      cannot sleep somehow. Shall feel better when my mind is at rest. I cannot
      report fully just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let the report rest. We know something already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superintendent Strong has sent us in a report, and a very creditable
      report, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Cameron indifferently. &ldquo;Well, the thing I want to say is
      that though all looks quiet&mdash;there is less horse stealing this month,
      and less moving about from the reserves&mdash;yet I believe a serious
      outbreak is impending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector, who had come around and taken a seat beside him, touched
      his knee at this point with an admonishing pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Cameron, turning toward him. &ldquo;Oh, my people here know. You need
      not have any fear about them.&rdquo; A little smile distorted his face as he
      laid his hand upon his wife's shoulder. &ldquo;But&mdash;where was I? I cannot
      get the hang of things.&rdquo; He was as a man feeling his way through a maze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let it go,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;Wait till you have had some sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must&mdash;I must get this out. Well, anyway, the principal thing
      is that Big Bear, Beardy, Poundmaker&mdash;though I am not sure about
      Poundmaker&mdash;have runners on every reserve and they are arranging for
      a big meeting in the spring, to which every tribe North and West is to
      send representatives. That Frenchman&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;I'll
      forget my own next&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riel?&rdquo; suggested the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Riel. That Frenchman is planning a big coup in the spring. You know
      they presented him with a house the other day, ready furnished, at
      Batoche, to keep him in the country. Oh, the half-breeds are very keen on
      this. And what is worse, I believe a lot of whites are in with them too. A
      chap named Jackson, and another named Scott, and Isbister and some others.
      These names are spoken of on every one of our reserves. I tell you, sir,&rdquo;
       he said, turning his blind eyes toward the Superintendent, &ldquo;I consider it
      very serious indeed. And worst of all, the biggest villain of the lot,
      Little Pine, Cree Chief you know, our bitterest enemy&mdash;except Little
      Thunder, who fortunately is cleared out of the country&mdash;you remember,
      sir, that chap Raven saw about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;where was I?&mdash;Oh, yes, Little Pine, the biggest villain
      of them all, is somewhere about here. I got word of him when I was at the
      Blood Reserve on my way home some ten days ago. I heard he was with the
      Blackfeet, but I found no sign of him there. But he is in the
      neighborhood, and he is specially bound to see old Crowfoot. I understand
      he is a particularly successful pleader, and unusually cunning, and I am
      afraid of Crowfoot. I saw the old Chief. He was very cordial and is
      apparently loyal enough as yet, but you know, sir, how much that may mean.
      I think that is all,&rdquo; said Cameron, putting his hand up to his head. &ldquo;I
      have a great deal more to tell you, but it will not come back to me now.
      Little Pine must be attended to, and for a day or two I am sorry I am
      hardly fit&mdash;awfully sorry.&rdquo; His voice sank into a kind of undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo; cried the Superintendent, deeply stirred at the sight of his
      obvious collapse. &ldquo;Sorry? Don't you use that word again. You have nothing
      to be sorry for, but everything to be proud of. You have done a great
      service to your country, and we will not forget it. In a few days you will
      be fit and we shall show our gratitude by calling upon you to do something
      more. Hello, who's that?&rdquo; A horseman had ridden past the window toward the
      stables. Moira ran to look out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it is that Mr. Raven. I would know his splendid horse
      anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven!&rdquo; said Cameron sharply and wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven, by Jove!&rdquo; muttered the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven! Well, I call that cool!&rdquo; said the Superintendent, a hard look upon
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the laws of hospitality are nowhere so imperative as on the western
      plains. Cameron rose from his chair muttering, &ldquo;Must look after his
      horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sit down,&rdquo; said Mandy firmly. &ldquo;You are not going out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;Here, Jerry, go and show him where to
      get things, and&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him in,&rdquo; cried Mandy heartily. The men stood silent, looking at
      Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, bring him in,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;a day like this,&rdquo; he added, as
      if in apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; cried Mandy, looking from one to the other in surprise.
      &ldquo;Why not? He is a perfectly splendid man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is really splendid!&rdquo; replied Moira, her cheeks burning and her
      eyes flashing. &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; she cried, addressing the Inspector, &ldquo;how
      he saved my life the day I arrived at this ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied the Inspector briefly, &ldquo;I believe I did hear that.&rdquo; But
      there was little enthusiasm in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think he is splendid,&rdquo; repeated Moira. &ldquo;Do not you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector had an awkward moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&mdash;well&mdash;I can't say I know him very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his horse! What a beauty it is!&rdquo; continued the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, a most beautiful animal, quite remarkable horse, splendid horse;
      in fact one of the finest, if not the very finest, in this whole country.
      And that is saying a good deal, too, Miss Moira. You see, this country
      breeds good horses.&rdquo; And the Inspector went on to discourse in full detail
      and with elaborate illustration upon the various breeds of horses the
      country could produce, and to classify the wonderful black stallion ridden
      by Raven, and all with such diligence and enthusiasm that no other of the
      party had an opportunity to take part in the conversation till Raven, in
      the convoy of Jerry, was seen approaching the house. Then the
      Superintendent rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Cameron, I fear we must take our departure. These are rather
      crowded days with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Mandy. &ldquo;Within an hour of dinner? We can hardly allow
      that, you know. Besides, Mr. Cameron wants to have a great deal more talk
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent attempted to set forth various other reasons for a
      hasty departure, but they all seemed to lack sincerity, and after a few
      more ineffective trials he surrendered and sat down again in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the door opened and Raven, followed by Jerry, stepped into
      the room. As his eye fell upon the Superintendent, instinctively he
      dropped his hands to his hips and made an involuntary movement backward,
      but only for an instant. Immediately he came forward and greeted Mandy
      with fine, old-fashioned courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So delighted to meet you again, Mrs. Cameron, and also to meet your
      charming sister.&rdquo; He shook hands with both the ladies very warmly. &ldquo;Ah,
      Superintendent,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;delighted to see you. And you, Inspector,&rdquo;
       he said, giving them a nod as he laid off his outer leather riding coat.
      &ldquo;Hope I see you flourishing,&rdquo; he continued. His debonair manner had in it
      a quizzical touch of humor. &ldquo;Ah, Cameron, home again I see. I came across
      your tracks the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men, who had risen to their feet upon his entrance, stood regarding
      him stiffly and made no other sign of recognition than a curt nod and a
      single word of greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had quite a trip,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to Cameron,
      and taking the chair offered by Mandy. &ldquo;I followed you part way, but you
      travel too fast for me. Much too strenuous work I found it. Why,&rdquo; he
      continued, looking narrowly at Cameron, &ldquo;you are badly punished. When did
      you get in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours ago, Mr. Raven,&rdquo; said Mandy quickly, for her husband sat gazing
      stupidly into the fire. &ldquo;And he is quite done up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours ago?&rdquo; exclaimed Raven in utter surprise. &ldquo;Do you mean to say
      that you have been traveling these last three days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear sir, not even the Indians face such cold. Only the Mounted
      Police venture out in weather like this&mdash;and those who want to get
      away from them. Ha! ha! Eh? Inspector? Ha! ha!&rdquo; His gay, careless laugh
      rang out in the most cheery fashion. But only the ladies joined. The men
      stood grimly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandy could not understand their grim and gloomy silence. By her
      cordiality she sought to cover up and atone for the studied and almost
      insulting indifference of her husband and her other guests. In these
      attempts she was loyally supported by her sister-in-law, whose anger was
      roused by the all too obvious efforts on the part of her brother and his
      friends to ignore this stranger, if not to treat him with contempt. There
      was nothing in Raven's manner to indicate that he observed anything amiss
      in the bearing of the male members of the company about the fire. He met
      the attempt of the ladies at conversation with a brilliancy of effort that
      quite captivated them, and, in spite of themselves, drew the
      Superintendent and the Inspector into the flow of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hour of the midday meal approached Mandy rose from her place by the
      fire and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stay with us to dinner, Mr. Raven? We dine at midday. It is not
      often we have such a distinguished and interesting company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; said Raven. &ldquo;I merely looked in to give your husband a
      bit of interesting information. And, by the way, I have a bit of
      information that might interest the Superintendent as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mandy, &ldquo;we are to have the pleasure of the Superintendent and
      the Inspector to dinner with us to-day, and you can give them all the
      information you think necessary while you are waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raven hesitated while he glanced at the faces of the men beside him. What
      he read there drew from him a little hard smile of amused contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not ask me again, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know not how you
      strain my powers of resistance when I really dare not&mdash;may not,&rdquo; he
      corrected himself with a quick glance at the Superintendent, &ldquo;stay in this
      most interesting company and enjoy your most grateful hospitality any
      longer. And now my information is soon given. First of all for you,
      Cameron&mdash;I shall not apologize to you, Mrs. Cameron, for delivering
      it in your presence. I do you the honor to believe that you ought to know&mdash;briefly
      my information is this. Little Pine, in whose movements you are all
      interested, I understand, is at this present moment lodging with the
      Sarcee Indians, and next week will move on to visit old Crowfoot. The
      Sarcee visit amounts to little, but the visit to old Crowfoot&mdash;well,
      I need say no more to you, Cameron. Probably you know more about the
      inside workings of old Crowfoot's mind than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visiting Crowfoot?&rdquo; exclaimed Cameron. &ldquo;Then I was there too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is his present intention, and I have no doubt the program will be
      carried out,&rdquo; said Raven. &ldquo;My information is from the inside. Of course,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;I know you have run across the trail of the North Cree and
      Salteaux runners from Big Bear and Beardy. They are not to be despised.
      But Little Pine is a different person from these gentlemen. The big game
      is scheduled for the early spring, will probably come off in about six
      weeks. And now,&rdquo; he said, rising from his chair, &ldquo;I must be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Smith came in and quietly took a seat beside Jerry near the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's your information for me, Mr. Raven?&rdquo; inquired the
      Superintendent. &ldquo;You are not going to deprive me of my bit of news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;news,&rdquo; replied Raven, sitting down again. &ldquo;Briefly this.
      Little Thunder has yielded to some powerful pressure and has again found
      it necessary to visit this country, I need hardly add, against my desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Thunder?&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent, and his tone indicated
      something more than surprise. &ldquo;Then there will be something doing. And
      where does this&mdash;ah&mdash;this&mdash;ah&mdash;friend of yours propose
      to locate himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This friend of mine,&rdquo; replied Raven, with a hard gleam in his eye and a
      bitter smile curling his lips, &ldquo;who would gladly adorn his person with my
      scalp if he might, will not ask my opinion as to his location, and
      probably not yours either, Mr. Superintendent.&rdquo; As Raven ceased speaking
      he once more rose from his chair, put on his leather riding coat and took
      up his cap and gauntlets. &ldquo;Farewell, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; he said, offering her
      his hand. &ldquo;Believe me, it has been a rare treat to see you and to sit by
      your fireside for one brief half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Mr. Raven, you are not to think of leaving us before dinner. Why
      this haste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trail I take,&rdquo; said Raven in a grave voice, &ldquo;is full of pitfalls and
      I must take it when I can. The Superintendent knows,&rdquo; he added. But his
      smile awoke no response in the Superintendent, who sat rigidly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a mighty cold day outside,&rdquo; interjected Smith, &ldquo;and blowing up
      something I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it, Raven!&rdquo; blurted out Cameron, who sat stupidly gazing into
      the fire, &ldquo;Stay and eat. This is no kind of day to go out hungry. It is
      too beastly cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Cameron, it IS a cold day, too cold to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do stay, Mr. Raven,&rdquo; pleaded Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned swiftly and looked into her soft brown eyes now filled with warm
      kindly light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, Miss Cameron,&rdquo; he replied in a low voice, turning his back upon the
      others, his voice and his attitude seeming to isolate the girl from the
      rest of the company, &ldquo;believe me, if I do not stay it is not because I do
      not want to, but because I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot?&rdquo; echoed Moira in an equally low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he replied. Then, raising his voice, &ldquo;Ask the Superintendent.
      He knows that I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; said Moira, turning upon the Superintendent, &ldquo;What does he
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent rose angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Raven chooses to be mysterious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If he cannot remain here
      he knows why without appealing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Superintendent, how unfeeling! You hardly do yourself
      justice,&rdquo; said Raven, proceeding to draw on his gloves. His drawling voice
      seemed to irritate the Superintendent beyond control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Justice?&rdquo; he exclaimed sharply. &ldquo;Justice is a word you should hesitate to
      use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Miss Cameron,&rdquo; said Raven with an injured air, &ldquo;why I cannot
      remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not!&rdquo; cried Moira in hot indignation. &ldquo;I do not see,&rdquo; she
      repeated, &ldquo;and if the Superintendent does I think he should explain.&rdquo; Her
      voice rang out sharp and clear. It wakened her brother as if from a daze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, Moira!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do not interfere where you do not
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why make insinuations that cannot be explained?&rdquo; cried his sister,
      standing up very straight and looking the Superintendent fair in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explained?&rdquo; echoed the Superintendent in a cool, almost contemptuous,
      voice. &ldquo;There are certain things best not explained, but believe me if Mr.
      Raven desires explanation he can have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men were all on their feet. Quickly Moira turned to Raven with a
      gesture of appeal and a look of loyal confidence in her eyes. For a moment
      the hard, cynical face was illumined with a smile of rare beauty, but only
      for a moment. The gleam passed and the old, hard, cynical face turned in
      challenge to the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain!&rdquo; he said bitterly, defiantly. &ldquo;Go on if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; breathed Moira, a thrill of triumphant relief in her voice, &ldquo;he
      cannot explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With dramatic swiftness the explanation came. It was from Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'explain?&rdquo; cried the little half-breed, quivering with rage. &ldquo;H'explain?
      What for he can no h'explain? Dem horse he steal de night-tam'&mdash;dat
      whiskee he trade on de Indian. Bah! He no good&mdash;he one beeg tief. Me&mdash;I
      put him one sure place he no steal no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments of tense silence held the group rigid. In the center stood
      Raven, his face pale, hard, but smiling, before him Moira, waiting, eager,
      with lips parted and eyes aglow with successive passions, indignation,
      doubt, fear, horror, grief. Again that swift and subtle change touched
      Raven's face as his eyes rested upon the face of the girl before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know why I cannot stay,&rdquo; he said gently, almost sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; murmured Moira, piteous appeal in voice and eyes. A
      spasm crossed the pale face upon which her eyes rested, then the old
      cynical look returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, thank you, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; he said with a bow to Mandy, &ldquo;for a
      happy half-hour by your fireside, and farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Mandy sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good-by, good-by,&rdquo; cried the girl impulsively, reaching out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;I shall not forget that you were kind to me.&rdquo;
       He bent low before her, but did not touch her outstretched hand. As he
      turned toward the door Jerry slipped in before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let him go?&rdquo; he cried excitedly, looking at the Superintendent; but
      before the latter could answer a hand caught him by the coat collar and
      with a swift jerk landed him on the floor. It was Smith, his face
      furiously red. Before Jerry could recover himself Raven had opened the
      door and passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how awful!&rdquo; said Mandy in a hushed, broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moira stood for a moment as if dazed, then suddenly turned to Smith and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. That was well done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Smith, red to his hair roots, murmured, &ldquo;You wanted him to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Moira, &ldquo;I wanted him to go.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WAR
    </h3>
    <p>
      Commissioner Irvine sat in his office at headquarters in the little town
      of Regina, the capital of the North West Territories of the Dominion. A
      number of telegrams lay before him on the table. A look of grave anxiety
      was on his face. The cause of his anxiety was to be found in the news
      contained in the telegrams. An orderly stood behind his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Inspector Sanders to me!&rdquo; commanded the Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orderly saluted and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Inspector Sanders made his appearance, a tall,
      soldierlike man, trim in appearance, prompt in movement and somewhat
      formal in speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the thing has come,&rdquo; said the Commissioner, handing Inspector
      Sanders one of the telegrams before him. Inspector Sanders took the wire,
      read it and stood very erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like it, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You always said it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just eight months since I first warned the government that trouble
      would come. Superintendent Crozier knows the situation thoroughly and
      would not have sent this wire if outbreak were not imminent. Then here is
      one from Superintendent Gagnon at Carlton. He also is a careful man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector Sanders gravely read the second telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to have five hundred men on the spot this minute,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked that a hundred men be sent up at once,&rdquo; said the
      Commissioner, &ldquo;but I am doubtful if we can get the Government to agree. It
      seems almost impossible to make the authorities feel the gravity of the
      situation. They cannot realize, for one thing, the enormous distances that
      separate points that look comparatively near together upon the map.&rdquo; He
      spread a map out upon the table. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;they have these
      maps before them, and the figures, but somehow the facts do not impress
      them. Look at this vast area lying between these four posts that form an
      almost perfect quadrilateral. Here is the north line running from Edmonton
      at the northwest corner to Prince Albert at the northeast, nearly four
      hundred miles away; then here is the south line running from Macleod at
      the southwest four hundred and fifty miles to Regina at the southeast;
      while the sides of this quadrilateral are nearly three hundred miles long.
      Thus the four posts forming our quadrilateral are four hundred miles apart
      one way by three hundred another, and, if we run the lines down to the
      boundary and to the limit of the territory which we patrol, the disturbed
      area may come to be about five hundred miles by six hundred; and we have
      some five hundred men available.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good thing we have established the new post at Carlton,&rdquo;
       suggested Inspector Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, there is Carlton. It is true we have strengthened up that
      district recently with two hundred men distributed between Battleford,
      Prince Albert, Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton. But Carlton is naturally a very
      weak post and is practically of little use to us. True, it guards us
      against those Willow Crees and acts as a check upon old Beardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A troublesome man, that Kah-me-yes-too-waegs&mdash;old Beardy, I mean. It
      took me some time to master that one,&rdquo; said Inspector Sanders, &ldquo;but then I
      have studied German. He always has been a nuisance,&rdquo; continued the
      Inspector. &ldquo;He was a groucher when the treaty was made in '76 and he has
      been a groucher ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we only had the men, just another five hundred,&rdquo; replied the
      Commissioner, tapping the map before him with his finger, &ldquo;we should hold
      this country safe. But what with these restless half-breeds led by this
      crack-brained Riel, and these ten thousand Indians&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to speak of a couple of thousand non-treaty Indians roaming the
      country and stirring up trouble,&rdquo; interjected the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; replied the Commissioner, &ldquo;but I would have no fear of the
      Indians were it not for these half-breeds. They have real grievances,
      remember, Sanders, real grievances, and that gives force to their quarrel
      and cohesion to the movement. Men who have a conviction that they are
      suffering injustice are not easily turned aside. And these men can fight.
      They ride hard and shoot straight and are afraid of nothing. I confess
      frankly it looks very serious to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Inspector Sanders, &ldquo;it is the Indians I fear most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Indians?&rdquo; said the Commissioner. &ldquo;Yes, if once they rise. Really, one
      wonders at the docility of the Indians, and their response to fair and
      decent treatment. Why, just think of it! Twenty years ago, no, fifteen
      years ago, less than fifteen years ago, these Indians whom we have been
      holding in our hand so quietly were roaming these plains, living like
      lords on the buffalo and fighting like fiends with each other, free from
      all control. Little wonder if, now feeling the pinch of famine, fretting
      under the monotony of pastoral life, and being incited to war by the
      hot-blooded half-breeds, they should break out in rebellion. And what is
      there to hold them back? Just this, a feeling that they have been justly
      treated, fairly and justly dealt with by the Government, and a wholesome
      respect for Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police, if I do say it
      myself. But the thing is on, and we must be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank God, there is not much to be done in the way of preparation,&rdquo;
       replied the Commissioner. &ldquo;Our fellows are ready to a man. For the past
      six months we have been on the alert for this emergency, but we must
      strike promptly. When I think of these settlers about Prince Albert and
      Battleford at the mercy of Beardy and that restless and treacherous
      Salteaux, Big Bear, I confess to a terrible anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is the West, sir, as well,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;the Blackfeet and
      the Bloods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, Sanders! You know them well. So do I. It is a great matter that
      Crowfoot is well disposed toward us, that he has confidence in our
      officers and that he is a shrewd old party as well. But Crowfoot is an
      Indian and the head of a great tribe with warlike traditions and with
      ambitions, and he will find it difficult to maintain his own loyalty, and
      much more that of his young men, in the face of any conspicuous successes
      by his Indian rivals, the Crees. But,&rdquo; added the Commissioner, rolling up
      the map, &ldquo;I called you in principally to say that I wish you to have every
      available man and gun ready for a march at a day's notice. Further, I wish
      you to wire Superintendent Herchmer at Calgary to send at the earliest
      possible moment twenty-five men at least, fully equipped. We shall need
      every man we can spare from every post in the West to send North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir. They will be ready,&rdquo; said Inspector Sanders, and,
      saluting, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, on the 18th of March, long before the break of day, the
      Commissioner set out on his famous march to Prince Albert, nearly three
      hundred miles away. And the great game was on. They were but a small
      company of ninety men, but every man was thoroughly fit for the part he
      was expected to play in the momentous struggle before him; brave, of
      course, trained in prompt initiative, skilled in plaincraft, inured to
      hardship, oblivious of danger, quick of eye, sure of hand and rejoicing in
      fight. Commissioner Irvine knew he could depend upon them to see through
      to a finish, to their last ounce of strength and their last blood-drop,
      any bit of work given them to do. Past Pie-a-pot's Reserve and down the
      Qu'Appelle Valley to Misquopetong's, through the Touchwood Hills and
      across the great Salt Plain, where he had word by wire from Crozier of the
      first blow being struck at the south branch of the Saskatchewan where some
      of Beardy's men gave promise of their future conduct by looting a store,
      Irvine pressed his march. Onward along the Saskatchewan, he avoided the
      trap laid by four hundred half-breeds at Batoche's Crossing, and, making
      the crossing at Agnew's, further down, arrived at Prince Albert all fit
      and sound on the eve of the 24th, completing his two hundred and
      ninety-one miles in just seven days; and that in the teeth of the bitter
      weather of a rejuvenated winter, without loss of man or horse, a feat
      worthy of the traditions of the Force of which he was the head, and of the
      Empire whose most northern frontier it was his task to guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours to sharpen their horses' calks and tighten up their
      cinches, and Irvine was on the trail again en route for Fort Carlton,
      where he learned serious disturbances were threatening. Arrived at Fort
      Carlton in the afternoon of the same day, the Commissioner found there a
      company of men, sad, grim and gloomy. In the fort a dozen of the gallant
      volunteers from Prince Albert and Crozier's Mounted Police lay groaning,
      some of them dying, with wounds. Others lay with their faces covered,
      quiet enough; while far down on the Duck Lake trail still others lay with
      the white snow red about them. The story was told the Commissioner with
      soldierlike brevity by Superintendent Crozier. The previous day a
      storekeeper from Duck Lake, Mitchell by name, had ridden in to report that
      his stock of provisions and ammunition was about to be seized by the
      rebels. Immediately early next morning a Sergeant of the Police with some
      seventeen constables had driven off to prevent these provisions and
      ammunition falling into the hands of the enemy. At ten o'clock a scout
      came pounding down the trail with the announcement that Sergeant Stewart
      was in trouble and that a hundred rebels had disputed his advance. Hard
      upon the heels of the scout came the Sergeant himself with his constables
      to tell their tale to a body of men whose wrath grew as they listened.
      More and more furious waxed their rage as they heard the constables tell
      of the threats and insults heaped upon them by the half-breeds and
      Indians. The Prince Albert volunteers more especially were filled with
      indignant rage. To think that half-breeds and Indians&mdash;Indians, mark
      you!&mdash;whom they had been accustomed to regard with contempt, should
      have dared to turn back upon the open trail a company of men wearing the
      Queen's uniform! The insult was intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Police officers received the news with philosophic calm. It was merely
      an incident in the day's work to them. Sooner or later they would bring
      these bullying half-breeds and yelling Indians to task for their temerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the volunteers were undisciplined in the business of receiving
      insults. Hence they were for an immediate attack. The Superintendent
      pointed out that the Commissioner was within touch bringing
      reinforcements. It might be wise to delay matters a few hours till his
      arrival. But meantime the provisions and ammunition would be looted and
      distributed among the enemy, and that was a serious matter. The impetuous
      spirit of the volunteers prevailed. Within an hour a hundred men with a
      seven-pr. gun, eager to exact punishment for the insults they had
      suffered, took the Duck Lake trail. Ambushed by a foe who, regardless of
      the conventions of war, made treacherous use of the white flag,
      overwhelmed by more than twice their number, hampered in their evolutions
      by the deep crusted snow, the little company, after a half-hour's sharp
      engagement with the strongly posted enemy, were forced to retire, bearing
      their wounded and some of their dead with them, leaving others of their
      dead lying in the snow behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the question was what was to be done? The events of the day had
      taught them their lesson, a lesson that experience has taught all
      soldiers, the lesson, namely, that it is never safe to despise a foe. A
      few miles away from them were between three hundred and four hundred
      half-breeds and Indians who, having tasted blood, were eager for more. The
      fort at Carlton was almost impossible of defense. The whole South country
      was in the hands of rebels. Companies of half-breeds breathing blood and
      fire, bands of Indians, marauding and terrorizing, were roaming the
      country, wrecking homesteads, looting stores, threatening destruction to
      all loyal settlers and direst vengeance upon all who should dare to oppose
      them. The situation called for quick thought and quick action. Every hour
      added to the number of the enemy. Whole tribes of Indians were wavering in
      their allegiance. Another victory such as Duck Lake and they would swing
      to the side of the rebels. The strategic center of the English settlements
      in all this country was undoubtedly Prince Albert. Fort Carlton stood
      close to the border of the half-breed section and was difficult of
      defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short council of war it was decided to abandon Fort Carlton.
      Thereupon Irvine led his troops, together with the gallant survivors of
      the bloody fight at Duck Lake, bearing their dead and wounded with them,
      to Prince Albert, there to hold that post with its hundreds of defenseless
      women and children gathered in from the country round about, against
      hostile half-breeds without and treacherous half-breeds within the
      stockade, and against swarming bands of Indians hungry for loot and
      thirsting for blood. And there Irvine, chafing against inactivity, eager
      for the joyous privilege of attack, spent the weary anxious days of the
      next six weeks, held at his post by the orders of his superior officer and
      by the stern necessities of the case, and meantime finding some slight
      satisfaction in scouting and scouring the country for miles on every side,
      thus preventing any massing of the enemy's forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair at Duck Lake put an end to all parley. Riel had been clamoring
      for &ldquo;blood! blood! blood!&rdquo; At Duck Lake he received his first taste, but
      before many days were over he was to find that for every drop of blood
      that reddened the crusted snow at Duck Lake a thousand Canadian voices
      would indignantly demand vengeance. The rifle-shots that rang out that
      winter day from the bluffs that lined the Duck Lake trail echoed
      throughout Canada from ocean to ocean, and everywhere men sprang to offer
      themselves in defense of their country. But echoes of these rifle-shots
      rang, too, in the teepees on the Western plains where the Piegans, the
      Bloods and the Blackfeet lay crouching and listening. By some mysterious
      system of telegraphy known only to themselves old Crowfoot and his braves
      heard them almost as soon as the Superintendent at Fort Macleod. Instantly
      every teepee was pulsing with the fever of war. The young braves dug up
      their rifles from their bedding, gathered together their ammunition,
      sharpened their knives and tomahawks in eager anticipation of the call
      that would set them on the war-path against the white man who had robbed
      them of their ancient patrimony and who held them in such close leash. The
      great day had come, the day they had been dreaming of in their hearts,
      talking over at their council-fires and singing about in their sun dances
      during the past year, the day promised by the many runners from their
      brother Crees of the North, the day foretold by the great Sioux orator and
      leader, Onawata. The war of extermination had begun and the first blood
      had gone to the Indian and to his brother half-breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after Duck Lake came the word that Fort Carlton had been
      abandoned and Battleford sacked. Five days later the news of the bloody
      massacre of Frog Lake cast over every English settlement the shadow of a
      horrible fear. From the Crow's Nest to the Blackfoot Crossing bands of
      braves broke loose from the reserves and began to &ldquo;drive cattle&rdquo; for the
      making of pemmican in preparation for the coming campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a day of testing for all Canadians, but especially a day of testing
      for the gallant little force of six or seven hundred riders who,
      distributed in small groups over a vast area of over two hundred and fifty
      thousand square miles, were entrusted with the responsibility of guarding
      the lives and property of Her Majesty's subjects scattered in lonely and
      distant settlements over these wide plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the testing found them ready. For while the Ottawa authorities with
      late but frantic haste were hustling their regiments from all parts of
      Canada to the scene of war, the Mounted Police had gripped the situation
      with a grip so stern that the Indian allies of the half-breed rebels
      paused in their leap, took a second thought and decided to wait till
      events should indicate the path of discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, to the blood-lusting Riel, Irvine's swift thrust Northward to Prince
      Albert suggested caution, while his resolute stand at that distant fort
      drove hard down in the North country a post of Empire that stuck fast and
      sure while all else seemed to be sliding to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspector Dickens, too, another of that fearless band of Police officers,
      holding with his heroic little company of twenty-two constables Fort Pitt
      in the far North, stayed the panic consequent upon the Frog Lake massacre
      and furnished food for serious thought to the cunning Chief, Little Pine,
      and his four hundred and fifty Crees, as well as to the sullen Salteaux,
      Big Bear, with his three hundred braves. And to the lasting credit of
      Inspector Dickens it stands that he brought his little company of
      twenty-two safe through a hostile country overrun with excited Indians and
      half-breeds to the post of Battleford, ninety-eight miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Battleford, also, after the sacking of the town, Inspector Morris with
      two hundred constables behind his hastily-constructed barricade kept guard
      over four hundred women and children and held at bay a horde of savages
      yelling for loot and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Griesbach, in like manner, with his little handful, at Fort Saskatchewan,
      held the trail to Edmonton, and materially helped to bar the way against
      Big Bear and his marauding band.
    </p>
    <p>
      And similarly at other points the promptness, resource, wisdom and
      dauntless resolution of the gallant officers of the Mounted Police and of
      the men they commanded saved Western Canada from the complete subversion
      of law and order in the whole Northern part of the territories and from
      the unspeakable horrors of a general Indian uprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while in the Northern and Eastern part of the Territories the Police
      officers rendered such signal service in the face of open rebellion, it
      was in the foothill country in the far West that perhaps even greater
      service was rendered to Canada and the Empire in this time of peril by the
      officers and men of the Mounted Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due to the influence of such men as the Superintendents and
      Inspectors of the Police in charge of the various posts throughout the
      foothill country more than to anything else that the Chiefs of the &ldquo;great,
      warlike, intelligent and untractable tribes&rdquo; of Blackfeet, Blood, Piegan,
      Sarcee and Stony Indians were prevented from breaking their treaties and
      joining with the rebel Crees, Salteaux and Assiniboines of the North and
      East. For fifteen years the Chiefs of these tribes had lived under the
      firm and just rule of the Police, had been protected from the rapacity of
      unscrupulous traders and saved from the ravages of whisky-runners. It was
      the proud boast of a Blood Chief that the Police never broke a promise to
      the Indian and never failed to exact justice either for his punishment or
      for his protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence when the reserves were being overrun by emissaries from the
      turbulent Crees and from the plotting half-breeds, in the face of the
      impetuous demands of their own young men and of their minor Chiefs to join
      in the Great Adventure, the great Chiefs, Red Crow and Rainy Chief of the
      Bloods, Bull's Head of the Sarcees, Trotting Wolf of the Piegans, and more
      than all, Crowfoot, the able, astute, wise old head of the entire
      Blackfeet confederacy, held these young braves back from rebellion and
      thus gave time and opportunity to Her Majesty's Forces operating in the
      East and North to deal with the rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during those days of strain, strain beyond the estimate of all not
      immediately involved, it was the record of such men as the Superintendents
      and Inspectors in charge at Fort Macleod, at Fort Calgary and on the line
      of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction in the mountains, and their
      steady bearing that more than anything else weighed with the great Chiefs
      and determined for them their attitude. For with calm, cool courage the
      Police patrols rode in and out of the reserves, quietly reasoning with the
      big Chiefs, smiling indulgently upon the turbulent minor Chiefs, checking
      up with swift, firm, but tactful justice the many outbreaks against law
      and order, presenting even in their most desperate moments such a front of
      resolute self-confidence to the Indians, and refusing to give any sign by
      look or word or act of the terrific anxiety they carried beneath their gay
      scarlet coats. And the big Chiefs, reading the faces of these cool,
      careless, resolute, smiling men who had a trick of appearing at unexpected
      times in their camps and refused to be hurried or worried, finally decided
      to wait a little longer. And they waited till the fatal moment of danger
      was past and the time for striking&mdash;and in the heart of every Chief
      of them the desire to strike for larger freedom and independence lay deep&mdash;was
      gone. To these guardians of Empire who fought no fight, who endured no
      siege, who witnessed no massacre, the Dominion and the Empire owe more
      than none but the most observing will ever know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paralleling these prompt measures of the North West Mounted Police, the
      Government dispatched from both East and West of Canada regiments of
      militia to relieve the beleaguered posts held by the Police, to prevent
      the spread of rebellion and to hold the great tribes of the Indians of the
      far West true to their allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already on the 27th of March, before Irvine had decided to abandon Fort
      Carlton and to make his stand at Prince Albert, General Middleton had
      passed through Winnipeg on his way to take command of the Canadian Forces
      operating in the West; and before two weeks more had gone the General was
      in command of a considerable body of troops at Qu'Appelle, his temporary
      headquarters. From all parts of Canada these men gathered, from Quebec and
      Montreal, from the midland counties of Ontario, from the city of Toronto
      and from the city of Winnipeg, till some five or six thousand
      citizen-soldiers were under arms. They were needed, too, every man, not so
      much because of the possible weight of numbers of the enemy opposing them,
      nor because of the tactical skill of those leading the hostile forces, but
      because of the enemy's advantage of position, owing to the nature of the
      country which formed the scene of the Rebellion, and because of the
      character of the warfare adopted by their cunning foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record of the brief six weeks' campaign constitutes a creditable page
      in Canadian history, a page which no Canadian need blush to read aloud in
      the presence of any company of men who know how to estimate at their
      highest value those qualities of courage and endurance that are the
      characteristics of the British soldier the world over.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TO ARMS!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Superintendent Strong was in a pleasant mood, and the reason was not far
      to seek. The distracting period of inaction, of doubt, of hesitation was
      past, and now at last something would be done. His term of service along
      the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction had been far from
      congenial to him. There had been too much of the work of the ordinary
      patrol-officer about it. True, he did his duty faithfully and thoroughly,
      so faithfully, indeed, as to move the great men of the railway company to
      outspoken praise, a somewhat unusual circumstance. But now he was called
      back to the work that more properly belonged to an officer of Her
      Majesty's North West Mounted Police and his soul glowed with the
      satisfaction of those who, having been found faithful in uncongenial duty,
      are rewarded with an opportunity to do a bit of work which they
      particularly delight to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his twenty-five men, whom for the past year he had been polishing to
      a high state of efficiency in the trying work of police-duty in the
      railway construction-camp, he arrived in Calgary on the evening of the
      tenth of April, to find that post throbbing with military ardor and
      thrilling with rumors of massacres and sieges, of marching columns and
      contending forces. Small wonder that Superintendent Strong's face took on
      an appearance of grim pleasure. Straight to the Police headquarters he
      went, but there was no Superintendent there to welcome him. That gentleman
      had gone East to meet the troops and was by now under appointment as Chief
      of Staff to that dashing soldier, Colonel Otter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But meantime, though the Calgary Police Post was bare of men, there were
      other men as keen and as daring, if not so thoroughly disciplined for war,
      thronging the streets of the little town and asking only a leader whom
      they could follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late evening, but Calgary was an &ldquo;all night&rdquo; town, and every minute
      was precious, for minutes might mean lives of women and children. So down
      the street rode Superintendent Strong toward the Royal Hotel. At the
      hitching post of that hostelry a sad-looking broncho was tied, whose calm,
      absorbed and detached appearance struck a note of discord with his
      environment; for everywhere about him men and horses seemed to be in a
      turmoil of excitement. Everywhere men in cow-boy garb were careering about
      the streets or grouped in small crowds about the saloon doors. There were
      few loud voices, but the words of those who were doing the speaking came
      more rapidly than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a group was gathered in the rear of the sad-looking broncho before
      the door of the Royal Hotel. As the Superintendent loped up upon his big
      brown horse the group broke apart and, like birds disturbed at their
      feeding, circled about and closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, here's Superintendent Strong,&rdquo; said a voice. &ldquo;He'll know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; inquired the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the troops?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Prince Albert down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Middleton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to be done here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were many voices, all eager, and in them just a touch of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing do I know,&rdquo; said Superintendent Strong somewhat gravely. &ldquo;I
      have been up in the mountains and have heard little. I know that the
      Commissioner has gone north to Prince Albert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard about Duck Lake?&rdquo; inquired a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard we had a reverse there, and I know that General Middleton
      has arrived at Qu'Appelle and has either set out for the north or is about
      to set out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard about Frog Lake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frog Lake? No. That is up near Fort Pitt. What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence, then a deep voice replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ghastly massacre, women and children and priests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then another period of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indians?&rdquo; murmured the Superintendent in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, half-breeds and Indians,&rdquo; replied the deep voice. And again there
      was silence. The men waited for Superintendent Strong to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent sat on his big horse looking at them quietly, then he
      said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men, there are some five or six thousand Indians in this district.&rdquo; They
      were all thinking the same thing. &ldquo;I have twenty-five men with me.
      Superintendent Cotton at Macleod has less than a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men sat their horses in silence looking at him. One could hear their
      deep breathing and see the quiver of the horses under the gripping knees
      of their riders. Their minds were working swiftly. Ever since the news of
      the Frog Lake massacre had spread like a fire across the country these men
      had been carrying in their minds&mdash;rather, in their hearts&mdash;pictures
      that started them up in their beds at night broad awake and all in a cold
      sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent lowered his voice. The men leaned forward to listen. He
      had only a single word to say, a short sharp word it was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will join me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as if his question had released a spring drawn to its limit. From
      twenty different throats in twenty different tones, but with a single
      throbbing impulse, came the response, swift, full-throated, savage, &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;I!&rdquo; &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; &ldquo;Count me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; and in three minutes
      Superintendent Strong had secured the nucleus of his famous scouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at nine at the Barracks!&rdquo; said this grim and laconic
      Superintendent, and was about turning away when a man came out from the
      door of the Royal Hotel, drawn forth by that sudden savage yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Cameron!&rdquo; said the Superintendent, as the man moved toward the
      sad-appearing broncho, &ldquo;I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir. I am with you,&rdquo; was the reply as Cameron swung on to his
      horse. &ldquo;Wake up, Ginger!&rdquo; he said to his horse, touching him with his
      heel. Ginger woke up with an indignant snort and forthwith fell into line
      with the Superintendent's big brown horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent was silent till the Barracks were gained, then, giving
      the horses into the care of an orderly, he led Cameron into the office and
      after they had settled themselves before the fire he began without
      preliminaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cameron, I am more anxious than I can say about the situation here in
      this part of the country. I have been away from the center of things for
      some months and I have lost touch. I want you to let me know just what is
      doing from our side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know much, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;I, too, have just come in
      from a long parley with Crowfoot and his Chiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, by the way, how is the old boy?&rdquo; inquired the Superintendent. &ldquo;Will
      he stick by us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present he is very loyal, sir,&mdash;too loyal almost,&rdquo; said Cameron
      in a doubtful tone. &ldquo;Duck Lake sent some of his young men off their heads
      a bit, and Frog Lake even more. The Sarcees went wild over Frog Lake, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't worry about the Sarcees so much. What of Crowfoot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has managed to hold down his younger Chiefs so far. He made
      light of the Frog Lake affair, but he was most anxious to get from me the
      fullest particulars of the Duck Lake fight. He made careful inquiries as
      to just how many Police were in the fight. I could see that it gave him a
      shock to learn that the Police had to retire. This was a new experience
      for him. He was intensely anxious to learn also&mdash;though he would not
      allow himself to appear so&mdash;just what the Government was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are the last reports from headquarters? You see I have not been
      kept fully in touch. I know that the Commissioner has gone north to Prince
      Albert and that General Middleton has taken command of the forces in the
      West and has gone North with them from Qu'Appelle, but what troops he has
      I have not heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;that he has three regiments of infantry
      from Toronto and three from Winnipeg, with the Winnipeg Field Battery. A
      regiment from Quebec has arrived and one from Montreal and there are more
      to follow. The plan of campaign I know nothing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent, &ldquo;I know something about the plan,
      I believe. There are three objective points, Prince Albert and Battleford,
      both of which are now closely besieged, and Edmonton, which is threatened
      with a great body of rebel Crees and Salteaux under leadership of Little
      Pine and Big Bear. The Police at these points can hardly be expected to
      hold out long against the overwhelming numbers that are besieging them,
      and I expect that relief columns will be immediately dispatched. Now, in
      regard to this district here, do you know what is being done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, General Strange has come in from his ranch and has offered his
      services in raising a local force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was glad to hear that his offer had been accepted and that he has
      been appointed to lead an expeditionary force from here to Edmonton. He is
      an experienced officer and I am sure will do us fine service. I hope to
      see him to-morrow. Now, about the South,&rdquo; continued the Superintendent,
      &ldquo;what about Fort Macleod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Superintendent there has offered himself and his whole force for
      service in the North, but General Middleton, I understand, has asked him
      to remain where he is and keep guard in this part of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I am glad of that. In my judgment this country holds the key. The
      Crees I do not fear so much. They are more restless and uncertain, but God
      help us if the Blackfeet and the Bloods rise! That is why I called for
      volunteers to-night. We cannot afford to be without a strong force here a
      single day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gathered that you got some volunteers to-night. I hope, sir,&rdquo; said
      Cameron, &ldquo;you will have a place for me in your troop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, nothing would please me better, I assure you,&rdquo; said the
      Superintendent cordially. &ldquo;And as proof of my confidence in you I am going
      to send you through the South country to recruit men for my troop. I can
      rely upon your judgment and tact. But as for you, you cannot leave your
      present beat. The Sun Dance Trail cannot be abandoned for one hour. From
      it you keep an eye upon the secret movements of all the tribes in this
      whole region and you can do much to counteract if not to wholly check any
      hostile movement that may arise. Indeed, you have already done more than
      any one will ever know to hold this country safe during these last months.
      And you must stay where you are. Remember, Cameron,&rdquo; added the
      Superintendent impressively, &ldquo;your work lies along the Sun Dance Trail. On
      no account and for no reason must you be persuaded to abandon that post. I
      shall get into touch with General Strange to-morrow and shall doubtless
      get something to do, but if possible I should like you to give me a day or
      two for this recruiting business before you take up again your patrol work
      along the Sun Dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron quietly, trying hard to keep the
      disappointment out of his voice. &ldquo;I shall do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;By the way, what are the
      Piegans doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Piegans,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;are industriously stealing cattle and
      horses. I cannot quite make out just how they can manage to get away with
      them. Eagle Feather is apparently running the thing, but there is someone
      bigger than Eagle Feather in the game. An additional month or two in the
      guardroom would have done that gentleman no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, has he been in the guard-room? How did he get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I pulled him out of the Sun Dance, where I found he had been killing
      cattle, and the Superintendent at Macleod gave him two months to meditate
      upon his crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Superintendent Strong expressed his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now he is at his old habits again,&rdquo; continued Cameron. &ldquo;But his is
      not the brain planning these raids. They are cleverly done and are getting
      serious. For instance, I must have lost a score or two of steers within
      the last three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A score or two?&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent. &ldquo;What are they doing with
      them all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I find difficult to explain. Either they are running them
      across the border&mdash;though the American Police know nothing of it&mdash;or
      they are making pemmican.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pemmican? Aha! that looks serious,&rdquo; said the Superintendent gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;It makes me think that some one bigger than
      Eagle Feather is at the bottom of all this cattle-running. Sometimes I
      have thought that perhaps that chap Raven has a hand in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven?&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent. &ldquo;He has brain enough and nerve in
      plenty for any dare-devil exploit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Cameron in a hesitating voice, &ldquo;I cannot bring myself to
      lay this upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; inquired the Superintendent sharply. &ldquo;He is a cool hand and
      desperate. I know his work fairly well. He is a first-class villain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know he is all that, and yet&mdash;well&mdash;in this rebellion,
      sir, I believe he is with us and against them.&rdquo; In proof of this Cameron
      proceeded to relate the story of Raven's visit to the Big Horn Ranch. &ldquo;So
      you see,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;he would not care to work in connection with the
      Piegans just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that&mdash;I don't know about that,&rdquo; replied the
      Superintendent. &ldquo;Of course he would not work against us directly, but he
      might work for himself in this crisis. It would furnish him with a good
      opportunity, you see. It would give him plenty of cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true, but still&mdash;I somehow cannot help liking the
      chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liking the chap?&rdquo; echoed the Superintendent. &ldquo;He is a cold-blooded
      villain and cattle-thief, a murderer, as you know. If ever I get my hand
      on him in this rumpus&mdash;Why, he's an outlaw pure and simple! I have no
      use for that kind of man at all. I should like to hang him!&rdquo; The
      Superintendent was indignant at the suggestion that any but the severest
      measures should be meted out to a man of Raven's type. It was the instinct
      and training of the Police officer responsible for the enforcement of law
      and order in the land moving within him. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the
      Superintendent, &ldquo;let us get back to our plans. There must be a strong
      force raised in this district immediately. We have the kind of men best
      suited for the work all about us in this ranching country, and I know that
      if you ride south throughout the ranges you can bring me back fifty men,
      and there would be no finer anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do what I can, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;but I am not sure about
      the fifty men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long they talked over the plans, till it was far past midnight, when
      Cameron took his leave and returned to his hotel. He put up his own horse,
      looking after his feeding and bedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some work to do, Ginger, for your Queen and country to-morrow,
      and you must be fit,&rdquo; he said as he finished rubbing the horse down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ginger had work to do, but not that planned for him by his master, as
      it turned out. At the door of the Royal Hotel, Cameron found waiting him
      in the shadow a tall slim Indian youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Who are you and what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the youth stepped into the light there came to Cameron a dim suggestion
      of something familiar about the lad, not so much in his face as in his
      figure and bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said Cameron again somewhat impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man pulled up his trouser leg and showed a scarred ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Now I get you. You are the young Piegan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&rdquo; said the youth, throwing back his head with a haughty movement. &ldquo;No
      Piegan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, of course. Onawata's son, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood silent, evidently finding speech difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eagle Feather,&rdquo; at length he said, &ldquo;Little Thunder&mdash;plenty Piegan&mdash;run
      much cattle.&rdquo; He made a sweeping motion with his arm to indicate the
      extent of the cattle raid proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, eh? Come in, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shook his head and drew back. He shared with all wild things the
      fear of inclosed places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they walked down the street and came to a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and eat. It is all right,&rdquo; said Cameron, offering his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian took the offered hand, laid it upon his heart, then for a full
      five seconds with his fierce black eye he searched Cameron's face.
      Satisfied, he motioned Cameron to enter and followed close on his heel.
      Never before had the lad been within four walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; said Cameron when the ordered meal was placed before them. The lad
      was obviously ravenous and needed no further urging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long since you left the reserve?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth held up three fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good going,&rdquo; said Cameron, letting his eye run down the lines of the
      Indian's lithe figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; inquired Cameron when the meal was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad's eye gleamed, but he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No pipe, eh?&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Come, we will mend that. Here, John,&rdquo; he
      said to the Chinese waiter, &ldquo;bring me a pipe. There,&rdquo; said Cameron,
      passing the Indian the pipe after filling it, &ldquo;smoke away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After another swift and searching look the lad took the pipe from
      Cameron's hand and with solemn gravity began to smoke. It was to him far
      more than a mere luxurious addendum to his meal. It was a solemn
      ceremonial sealing a compact of amity between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me,&rdquo; said Cameron, when the smoke had gone on for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and with painful difficulty the youth told his story in terse,
      brief sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T'ree day,&rdquo; he began, holding up three fingers, &ldquo;me hear Eagle Feather&mdash;many
      Piegans&mdash;talk&mdash;talk&mdash;talk. Go fight&mdash;keel&mdash;keel&mdash;keel
      all white man, squaw, papoose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; inquired Cameron, keeping his face steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come Cree runner&mdash;soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean they are waiting for a runner from the North?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
      &ldquo;If the Crees win the fight then the Piegans will rise? Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian nodded. &ldquo;Come Cree Indian&mdash;then Piegan fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not rise until the runner comes, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron breathed more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he inquired carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day Eagle Feather run much cattle&mdash;beeg&mdash;beeg run.&rdquo; The
      young man again swept the room with his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Eagle Feather is no good. He is an old squaw,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; agreed the Indian quickly. &ldquo;Little Thunder go too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Thunder, eh?&rdquo; said Cameron, controlling his voice with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad nodded, his piercing eye upon Cameron's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes Cameron smoked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Onawata?&rdquo; With startling suddenness he shot out the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a line of the Indian's face moved. He ignored the question, smoking
      steadily and looking before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it is a strange way for Onawata to repay the white man's kindness to
      his son,&rdquo; said Cameron. The contemptuous voice pierced the Indian's armor
      of impassivity. Cameron caught the swift quiver in the face that told that
      his stab had reached the quick. There is nothing in the Indian's catalogue
      of crimes so base as the sin of ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onawata beeg Chief&mdash;beeg Chief,&rdquo; at length the boy said proudly. &ldquo;He
      do beeg&mdash;beeg t'ing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he steals my cattle,&rdquo; said Cameron with stinging scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the Indian sharply. &ldquo;Little Thunder&mdash;Eagle Feather
      steal cattle&mdash;Onawata no steal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it, then,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;This is a big run of cattle,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;beeg&mdash;beeg run.&rdquo; Again the Indian's arm swept the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they do with all those cattle?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again the Indian ignored his question and remained silently smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does the son of Onawata come to me?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft and subtle change transformed the boy's face. He pulled up his
      trouser leg and, pointing to the scarred ankle, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You' squaw good&mdash;me two leg&mdash;me come tell you take squaw 'way
      far&mdash;no keel. Take cattle 'way&mdash;no steal.&rdquo; He rose suddenly to
      his feet. &ldquo;Me go now,&rdquo; he said, and passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Cameron, following him out to the door. &ldquo;Where are you
      going to sleep to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy waved his hand toward the hills surrounding the little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Cameron, emptying his tobacco pouch into the boy's hand. &ldquo;I
      will tell my squaw that Onawata's son is not ungrateful, that he
      remembered her kindness and has paid it back to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time a smile broke on the grave face of the Indian. He took
      Cameron's hand, laid it upon his own heart, and then on Cameron's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You' squaw good&mdash;good&mdash;much good.&rdquo; He appeared to struggle to
      find other words, but failing, and with a smile still lingering upon his
      handsome face, he turned abruptly away and glided silent as a shadow into
      the starlit night. Cameron watched him out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad sort,&rdquo; he said to himself as he walked toward the hotel.
      &ldquo;Pretty tough thing for him to come here and give away his dad's scheme
      like that&mdash;and I bet you he is keen on it himself too.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN OUTLAW, BUT A MAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      The news brought by the Indian lad changed for Cameron all his plans. This
      cattle-raid was evidently a part of and preparation for the bigger thing,
      a general uprising and war of extermination on the part of the Indians.
      From his recent visit to the reserves he was convinced that the loyalty of
      even the great Chiefs was becoming somewhat brittle and would not bear any
      sudden strain put upon it. A successful raid of cattle such as was being
      proposed escaping the notice of the Police, or in the teeth of the Police,
      would have a disastrous effect upon the prestige of the whole Force,
      already shaken by the Duck Lake reverse. The effect of that skirmish was
      beyond belief. The victory of the half-breeds was exaggerated in the
      wildest degree. He must act and act quickly. His home and his family and
      those of his neighbors were in danger of the most horrible fate that could
      befall any human being. If the cattle-raid were carried through by the
      Piegan Indians its sweep would certainly include the Big Horn Ranch, and
      there was every likelihood that his home might be destroyed, for he was an
      object of special hate to Eagle Feather and to Little Thunder; and if
      Copperhead were in the business he had even greater cause for anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was to be done? The Indian boy had taken three days to bring the
      news. It would take a day and a night of hard riding to reach his home.
      Quickly he made his plans. He passed into the hotel, found the room of
      Billy the hostler and roused him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get my horse out quick and hitch him up to the post
      where I can get him. And Billy, if you love me,&rdquo; he implored, &ldquo;be quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy sprang from his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know what's eatin' you, boss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but quick's the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute Cameron was pounding at Dr. Martin's door upstairs.
      Happily the doctor was in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martin, old man,&rdquo; cried Cameron, gripping him hard by the shoulder. &ldquo;Wake
      up and listen hard! That Indian boy you and Mandy pulled through has just
      come all the way from the Piegan Reserve to tell me of a proposed
      cattle-raid and a possible uprising of the Piegans in that South country.
      The cattle-raid is coming on at once. The uprising depends upon news from
      the Crees. Listen! I have promised Superintendent Strong to spend the next
      two days recruiting for his new troop. Explain to him why I cannot do
      this. He will understand. Then ride like blazes to Macleod and tell the
      Inspector all that I have told you and get him to send what men he can
      spare along with you. You can't get a man here. The raid starts from the
      Piegan Reserve. It will likely finish where the old Porcupine Trail joins
      the Sun Dance. At least so I judge. Ride by the ranch and get some of them
      there to show you the shortest trail. Both Mandy and Moira know it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Cameron! Let me get this clear,&rdquo; cried the doctor, holding him
      fast by the arm. &ldquo;Two things I have gathered,&rdquo; said the doctor, speaking
      rapidly, &ldquo;first, a cattle-raid, then a general uprising, the uprising
      dependent upon the news from the North. You want to block the cattle-raid?
      Is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you want me to settle with Superintendent Storm, ride to Macleod for
      men, then by your ranch and have them show me the shortest trail to the
      junction of the Porcupine and the Sun Dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Martin, old boy. It is a great thing to have a head like
      yours. I shall meet you somewhere at that point. I have been thinking this
      thing over and I believe they mean to make pemmican in preparation for
      their uprising, and if so they will make it somewhere on the Sun Dance
      Trail. Now I am off. Let me go, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your own movements now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, the ranch,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;Then straight for the Sun Dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old boy. By-by and good-luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron found Billy waiting with Ginger at the door of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Billy,&rdquo; he said, fumbling in his pocket. &ldquo;Hang it, I can't
      find my purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go hang yourself!&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;Never mind your purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; said Cameron, giving him his hand. &ldquo;Good-by. You are a
      trump, Billy.&rdquo; He caught Ginger by the mane and threw himself on the
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, Ginger, you must not fail me this trip, if it is your last. A
      hundred and twenty miles, old boy, and you are none too fresh either. But,
      Ginger, we must beat them this time. A hundred and twenty miles to the Big
      Horn and twenty miles farther to the Sun Dance, that makes a hundred and
      forty, Ginger, and you are just in from a hard two days' ride. Steady,
      boy! Not too hard at the first.&rdquo; For Ginger was showing signs of eagerness
      beyond his wont. &ldquo;At all costs this raid must be stopped,&rdquo; continued
      Cameron, speaking, after his manner, to his horse, &ldquo;not for the sake of a
      few cattle&mdash;we could all stand that loss&mdash;but to balk at its
      beginning this scheme of old Copperhead's, for I believe in my soul he is
      at the bottom of it. Steady, old boy! We need every minute, but we cannot
      afford to make any miscalculations. The last quarter of an hour is likely
      to be the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So on they went through the starry night. Steadily Ginger pounded the
      trail, knocking off the miles hour after hour. There was no pause for rest
      or for food. A few mouthfuls of water in the fording of a running stream,
      a pause to recover breath before plunging into an icy river, or on the
      taking of a steep coulee side, but no more. Hour after hour they pressed
      forward toward the Big Horn Ranch. The night passed into morning and the
      morning into the day, but still they pressed the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of the day Cameron found himself within an hour's ride of
      his own ranch with Ginger showing every sign of leg weariness and almost
      of collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old chap!&rdquo; cried Cameron, leaning over him and patting his neck. &ldquo;We
      must make it. We cannot let up, you know. Stick to it, old boy, a little
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little snort and a little extra spurt of speed was the gallant Ginger's
      reply, but soon he was forced to sink back again into his stumbling
      stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hour more, Ginger, that is all&mdash;one hour only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he leapt from his saddle to ease his horse in climbing a long
      and lofty hill. As he surmounted the hill he stopped and swiftly backed
      his horse down the hill. Upon the distant skyline his eye had detected
      what he judged to be a horseman. His horse safely disposed of, he once
      more crawled to the top of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Indian, by Jove!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I wonder if he has seen me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carefully his eye swept the intervening valley and the hillside beyond,
      but only this solitary figure could he see. As his eye rested on him the
      Indian began to move toward the west. Cameron lay watching him for some
      minutes. From his movements it was evident that the Indian's pace was
      being determined by some one on the other side of the hill, for he
      advanced now swiftly, now slowly. At times he halted and turned back upon
      his track, then went forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is he doing?&rdquo; said Cameron to himself. &ldquo;By Jove! I have
      got it! The drive is begun. I am too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly he considered the whole situation. He was too late now to be of
      any service at his ranch. The raid had already swept past it. He wrung his
      hands in agony to think of what might have happened. He was torn with
      anxiety for his family&mdash;and yet here was the raid passing onward
      before his eyes. One hour would bring him to the ranch, but if this were
      the outside edge of the big cattle raid the loss of an hour would mean the
      loss of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God! What shall I do?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his eyes still upon the Indian he forced himself to think more
      quietly. The secrecy with which the raid was planned made it altogether
      likely that the homes of the settlers would not at this time be interfered
      with. This consideration finally determined him. At all costs he must do
      what he could to head off the raid or to break the herd in some way. But
      that meant in the first place a ride of twenty or twenty-five miles over
      rough country. Could Ginger do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He crawled back to his horse and found him with his head close to the
      ground and trembling in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he goes this twenty miles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he will go no more. But it looks
      like our only hope, old boy. We must make for our old beat, the Sun Dance
      Trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He mounted his horse and set off toward the west, taking care never to
      appear above the skyline and riding as rapidly as the uncertain footing of
      the untrodden prairie would allow. At short intervals he would dismount
      and crawl to the top of the hill in order to keep in touch with the
      Indian, who was heading in pretty much the same direction as himself. A
      little further on his screening hill began to flatten itself out and
      finally it ran down into a wide valley which crossed his direction at
      right angles. He made his horse lie down, still in the shelter of the
      hill, and with most painful care he crawled on hands and knees out to the
      open and secured a point of vantage from which he could command the valley
      which ran southward for some miles till it, in turn, was shut in by a
      further range of hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rewarded for his patience and care. Far down before him at the
      bottom of the valley a line of cattle was visible and hurrying them along
      a couple of Indian horsemen. As he lay watching these Indians he observed
      that a little farther on this line was augmented by a similar line from
      the east driven by the Indian he had first observed, and by two others who
      emerged from a cross valley still further on. Prone upon his face he lay,
      with his eyes on that double line of cattle and its hustling drivers. The
      raid was surely on. What could one man do to check it? Similar lines of
      cattle were coming down the different valleys and would all mass upon the
      old Porcupine Trail and finally pour into the Sun Dance with its many
      caves and canyons. There was much that was mysterious in this movement
      still to Cameron. What could these Indians do with this herd of cattle?
      The mere killing of them was in itself a vast undertaking. He was
      perfectly familiar with the Indian's method of turning buffalo meat, and
      later beef, into pemmican, but the killing, and the dressing, and the
      rendering of the fat, and the preparing of the bags, all this was an
      elaborate and laborious process. But one thing was clear to his mind. At
      all costs he must get around the head of these converging lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited there till the valley was clear of cattle and Indians, then,
      mounting his horse, he pushed hard across the valley and struck a parallel
      trail upon the farther side of the hills. Pursuing this trail for some
      miles, he crossed still another range of hills farther to the west and so
      proceeded till he came within touch of the broken country that marks the
      division between the Foothills and the Mountains. He had not many miles
      before him now, but his horse was failing fast and he himself was half
      dazed with weariness and exhaustion. Night, too, was falling and the going
      was rough and even dangerous; for now hillsides suddenly broke off into
      sharp cut-banks, twenty, thirty, forty feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of these cut-banks that was his undoing, for in the dim light
      he failed to note that the sheep track he was following ended thus
      abruptly till it was too late. Had his horse been fresh he could easily
      have recovered himself, but, spent as he was, Ginger stumbled, slid and
      finally rolled headlong down the steep hillside and over the bank on to
      the rocks below. Cameron had just strength to throw himself from the
      saddle and, scrambling on his knees, to keep himself from following his
      horse. Around the cut-bank he painfully made his way to where his horse
      lay with his leg broken, groaning like a human being in his pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old boy! You are done at last,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no time to indulge regrets. Those lines of cattle were
      swiftly and steadily converging upon the Sun Dance. He had before him an
      almost impossible achievement. Well he knew that a man on foot could do
      little with the wild range cattle. They would speedily trample him into
      the ground. But he must go on. He must make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first there was a task that it wrung his heart to perform. His horse
      must be put out of pain. He took off his coat, rolled it over his horse's
      head, inserted his gun under its folds to deaden the sound and to hide
      those luminous eyes turned so entreatingly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old boy, you have done your duty, and so must I. Good-by, old chap!&rdquo; He
      pulled the fatal trigger and Ginger's work was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up his coat and set off once more upon the winding sheep trail
      that he guessed would bring him to the Sun Dance. Dazed, half asleep,
      numbed with weariness and faint with hunger, he stumbled on, while the
      stars came out overhead and with their mild radiance lit up his rugged
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he found himself vividly awake. Diagonally across the face of the
      hill in front of him, a few score yards away and moving nearer, a horse
      came cantering. Quickly Cameron dropped behind a jutting rock. Easily,
      daintily, with never a slip or slide came the horse till he became clearly
      visible in the starlight. There was no mistaking that horse or that rider.
      No other horse in all the territories could take that slippery, slithery
      hill with a tread so light and sure, and no other rider in the Western
      country could handle his horse with such easy, steady grace among the
      rugged rocks of that treacherous hillside. It was Nighthawk and his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven!&rdquo; breathed Cameron to himself. &ldquo;Raven! Is it possible? By Jove! I
      would not have believed it. The Superintendent was right after all. He is
      a villain, a black-hearted villain too. So, HE is the brains behind this
      thing. I ought to have known it. Fool that I was! He pulled the wool over
      my eyes all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rage that surged up through his heart stimulated his dormant energies
      into new life. With a deep oath Cameron pulled out both his guns and set
      off up the hill on the trail of the disappearing horseman. His weariness
      fell from him like a coat, the spring came back to his muscles, clearness
      to his brain. He was ready for his best fight and he knew it lay before
      him. Swiftly, lightly he ran up the hillside. At the top he paused amazed.
      Before him lay a large Indian encampment with rows upon rows of tents and
      camp fires with kettles swinging, and everywhere Indians and squaws moving
      about. Skirting the camp and still keeping to the side of the hill, he
      came upon a stout new-built fence that ran straight down an incline to a
      steep cut-bank with a sheer drop of thirty feet or more. Like a flash the
      meaning of it came upon him. This was to be the end of the drive. Here the
      cattle were to meet their death. Here it was that the pemmican was to be
      made. On the hillside opposite there was doubtless a similar fence and
      these two would constitute the fatal funnel down which the cattle were to
      be stampeded over the cut-bank to their destruction. This was the
      nefarious scheme planned by Raven and his treacherous allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly Cameron turned and followed the fence up the incline some three or
      four hundred yards from the cut-bank. At its upper end the fence curved
      outward for some distance upon a wide upland valley, then ceased
      altogether. Such was the slope of the hill that no living man could turn a
      herd of cattle once entered upon that steep incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill, across the valley and up the other side ran Cameron,
      keeping low and carefully picking his way among the loose stones till he
      came to the other fence which, curving similarly outward, made with its
      fellow a perfectly completed funnel. Once between the curving lips of this
      funnel nothing could save the rushing, crowding cattle from the deadly
      cut-bank below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if I only had my horse,&rdquo; groaned Cameron, &ldquo;I might have a chance to
      turn them off just here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the point at which he stood the slope of the hillside fell somewhat
      toward the left and away slightly from the mouth of the funnel. A skilled
      cowboy with sufficient nerve, on a first-class horse, might turn the herd
      away from the cut-bank into the little coulee that led down from the end
      of the fence, but for a man on foot the thing was quite impossible. He
      determined, however, to make the effort. No man can certainly tell how
      cattle will behave when excited and at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there rapidly planning how to divert the rush of cattle from
      that deadly funnel, there rose on the still night air a soft rumbling
      sound like low and distant thunder. That sound Cameron knew only too well.
      It was the pounding of two hundred steers upon the resounding prairie. He
      rushed back again to the right side of the fenced runway, and then forward
      to meet the coming herd. A half moon rising over the round top of the hill
      revealed the black surging mass of steers, their hoofs pounding like
      distant artillery, their horns rattling like a continuous crash of
      riflery. Before them at a distance of a hundred yards or more a mounted
      Indian rode toward the farther side of the funnel and took his stand at
      the very spot at which there was some hope of diverting the rushing herd
      from the cut-bank down the side coulee to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man has got to go,&rdquo; said Cameron to himself, drawing his gun. But
      before he could level it there shot out from the dim light behind the
      Indian a man on horseback. Like a lion on its prey the horse leaped with a
      wicked scream at the Indian pony. Before that furious leap both man and
      pony went down and rolled over and over in front of the pounding herd.
      Over the prostrate pony leaped the horse and up the hillside fair in the
      face of that rushing mass of maddened steers. Straight across their face
      sped the horse and his rider, galloping lightly, with never a swerve or
      hesitation, then swiftly wheeling as the steers drew almost level with him
      he darted furiously on their flank and rode close at their noses. &ldquo;Crack!
      Crack!&rdquo; rang the rider's revolver, and two steers in the far flank dropped
      to the earth while over them surged the following herd. Again the revolver
      rang out, once, twice, thrice, and at each crack a leader on the flank
      farthest away plunged down and was submerged by the rushing tide behind.
      For an instant the column faltered on its left and slowly began to swerve
      in that direction. Then upon the leaders of the right flank the black
      horse charged furiously, biting, kicking, plunging like a thing possessed
      of ten thousand devils. Steadily, surely the line continued to swerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Cameron, unable to believe his eyes. &ldquo;They are turning!
      They are turned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With wild cries and discharging his revolver fair in the face of the
      leaders, Cameron rushed out into the open and crossed the mouth of the
      funnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back, you fool! Go back!&rdquo; yelled the man on horseback. &ldquo;Go back! I
      have them!&rdquo; He was right. Cameron's sudden appearance gave the final and
      necessary touch to the swerving movement. Across the mouth of the funnel
      with its yawning deadly cut-bank, and down the side coulee, carrying part
      of the fence with them, the herd crashed onward, with the black horse
      hanging on their flank still biting and kicking with a kind of joyous
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven! Raven!&rdquo; cried Cameron in glad accents. &ldquo;It is Raven! Thank God, he
      is straight after all!&rdquo; A great tide of gratitude and admiration for the
      outlaw was welling up in his heart. But even as he ran there thundered
      past him an Indian on horseback, the reins flying loose and a rifle in his
      hands. As he flashed past a gleam of moonlight caught his face, the face
      of a demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Thunder!&rdquo; cried Cameron, whipping out his gun and firing, but with
      no apparent effect, at the flying figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his gun still in his hand, Cameron ran on down the coulee in the wake
      of Little Thunder. Far away could be heard the roar of the rushing herd,
      but nothing could be seen of Raven. Running as he had never run in his
      life, Cameron followed hard upon the Indian's track, who was by this time
      some hundred yards in advance. Suddenly in the moonlight, and far down the
      coulee, Raven could be seen upon his black horse cantering easily up the
      slope and toward the swiftly approaching Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven! Raven!&rdquo; shouted Cameron, firing his gun. &ldquo;On guard! On guard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raven heard, looked up and saw the Indian bearing down upon him. His
      horse, too, saw the approaching foe and, gathering himself, in two short
      leaps rushed like a whirlwind at him, but, swerving aside, the Indian
      avoided the charging stallion. Cameron saw his rifle go up to his
      shoulder, a shot reverberated through the coulee, Raven swayed in his
      saddle. A second shot and the black horse was fair upon the Indian pony,
      hurling him to the ground and falling himself upon him. As the Indian
      sprang to his feet Raven was upon him. He gripped him by the throat and
      shook him as a dog shakes a rat. Once, twice, his pistol fell upon the
      snarling face and the Indian crumpled up and lay still, battered to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; cried Cameron, as he came up, struggling with his sobbing
      breath. &ldquo;You have got the beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have got him,&rdquo; said Raven, with his hand to his side, &ldquo;but I guess
      he has got me too. And&mdash;&rdquo; he paused. His eye fell upon his horse
      lying upon his side and feebly kicking&mdash;&ldquo;ah, I fear he has got you as
      well, Nighthawk, old boy.&rdquo; As he staggered over toward his horse the sound
      of galloping hoofs was heard coming down the coulee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are some more of them!&rdquo; cried Cameron, drawing out his guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Cameron, my boy, just back up here beside me,&rdquo; said Raven, as
      he coolly loaded his empty revolver. &ldquo;We can send a few more of these
      devils to hell. You are a good sport, old chap, and I want to go out in no
      better company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; cried Cameron. &ldquo;There is a woman. Why, there is a Policeman.
      They are friends, Raven. It is the doctor and Moira. Hurrah! Here you are,
      Martin. Quick! Quick! Oh, my God! He is dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raven had sunk to his knees beside his horse. They gathered round him, a
      Mounted Police patrol picked up on the way by Dr. Martin, Moira who had
      come to show them the trail, and Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nighthawk, old boy,&rdquo; they heard Raven say, his hand patting the shoulder
      of the noble animal, &ldquo;he has done for you, I fear.&rdquo; His voice came in
      broken sobs. The great horse lifted his beautiful head and looked round
      toward his master. &ldquo;Ah, my boy, we have done many a journey together!&rdquo;
       cried Raven as he threw his arm around the glossy neck, &ldquo;and on this last
      one too we shall not be far apart.&rdquo; The horse gave a slight whinny, nosed
      into his master's hand and laid his head down again. A slight quiver of
      the limbs and he was still for ever. &ldquo;Ah, he has gone!&rdquo; cried Raven, &ldquo;my
      best, my only friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Cameron, &ldquo;you are with friends now, Raven, old man.&rdquo; He
      offered his hand. Raven took it wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean it, Cameron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with all my heart. You are a true man, if God ever made one, and you
      have shown it to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Raven, with a kind of sigh as he sank back and leaned up
      against his horse. &ldquo;That is good to hear. It is long since I have had a
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Martin!&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;He is wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo; said the doctor, kneeling down beside him and tearing open
      his coat and vest. &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;He is&mdash;&rdquo; The
      doctor paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say? Oh, Dr. Martin, he is not badly wounded?&rdquo; Moira threw
      herself on her knees beside the wounded man and caught his hand. &ldquo;Oh, it
      is cold, cold,&rdquo; she cried through rushing tears. &ldquo;Can you not help him?
      Oh, you must not let him die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely he is not dying?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was silently and swiftly working with his syringe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long, Doctor?&rdquo; inquired Raven in a quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour, perhaps less,&rdquo; said the doctor brokenly. &ldquo;Have you any
      pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, very little. It is quite easy. Cameron,&rdquo; he said, his voice beginning
      to fail, &ldquo;I want you to send a letter which you will find in my pocket
      addressed to my brother. Tell no one the name. And add this, that I
      forgive him. It was really not worth while,&rdquo; he added wearily, &ldquo;to hate
      him so. And say to the Superintendent I was on the straight with him, with
      you all, with my country in this rebellion business. I heard about this
      raid; and I fancy I have rather spoiled their pemmican. I have run some
      cattle in my time, but you know, Cameron, a fellow who has worn the
      uniform could not mix in with these beastly breeds against the Queen, God
      bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Martin,&rdquo; cried the girl piteously, shaking him by the arm, &ldquo;do
      not tell me you can do nothing. Try&mdash;try something.&rdquo; She began again
      to chafe the cold hand, her tears falling upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raven looked up quickly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are weeping for me, Miss Moira?&rdquo; he said, surprise and wonder in his
      face. &ldquo;For me? A horse-thief, an outlaw, for me? I thank you. And forgive
      me&mdash;may I kiss your hand?&rdquo; He tried feebly to lift her hand to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Not my hand!&rdquo; and leaning over him she kissed
      him on the brow. His eyes were still upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said feebly, a rare, beautiful smile lighting up the white
      face. &ldquo;You make me believe in God's mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a quick movement in the group and Smith was kneeling beside the
      dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's mercy, Mr. Raven,&rdquo; he said in an eager voice, &ldquo;is infinite. Why
      should you not believe in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raven looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said with a quaintly humorous smile, &ldquo;you are the chap that
      chucked Jerry away from the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smith nodded, then said earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Raven, you must believe in God's mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's mercy,&rdquo; said the dying man slowly. &ldquo;Yes, God's mercy. What is it
      again? 'God&mdash;be&mdash;merciful&mdash;to me&mdash;a sinner.'&rdquo; Once
      more he opened his eyes and let them rest upon the face of the girl
      bending over him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you helped me to believe in God's
      mercy.&rdquo; With a sigh as of content he settled himself quietly against the
      shoulders of his dead horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old comrade,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;good-by!&rdquo; He closed his eyes and drew a deep
      breath. They waited for another, but there was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; cried Moira. &ldquo;Gone? Ochone, but he was the gallant gentleman!&rdquo; she
      wailed, lapsing into her Highland speech. &ldquo;Oh, but he had the brave heart
      and the true heart. Ochone! Ochone!&rdquo; She swayed back and forth upon her
      knees with hands clasped and tears running down her cheeks, bending over
      the white face that lay so still in the moonlight and touched with the
      majesty of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Moira! Come, Moira!&rdquo; said her brother surprised at her unwonted
      display of emotion. &ldquo;You must control yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave her alone. Let her cry. She is in a hard spot,&rdquo; said Dr. Martin in
      a sharp voice in which grief and despair were mingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron glanced at his friend's face. It was the face of a haggard old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are used up, old boy,&rdquo; he said kindly, putting his hand on the
      doctor's arm. &ldquo;You need rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest?&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Rest? Not I. But you do. And you too, Miss
      Moira,&rdquo; he added gently. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; giving her his hand, &ldquo;you must get home.&rdquo;
       There was in his voice a tone of command that made the girl look up
      quickly and obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done? Yes, but what matter? Take her home, Cameron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith, the constable and I will look after&mdash;him&mdash;and the horse.
      Send a wagon to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further word the brother and sister mounted their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, old man. See you to-morrow,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said the doctor shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said simply, her eyes full of a dumb pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Miss Moira,&rdquo; said the doctor, who held her hand for just a
      moment as if to speak again, then abruptly he turned his back on her
      without further word and so stood with never a glance more after her. It
      was for him a final farewell to hopes that had lived with him and had
      warmed his heart for the past three years. Now they were dead, dead as the
      dead man upon whose white still face he stood looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thief, murderer, outlaw,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Sure enough&mdash;sure
      enough. And yet you could not help it, nor could she.&rdquo; But he was not
      thinking of the dead man's record in the books of the Mounted Police.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GREAT CHIEF
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the rampart of hills overlooking the Piegan encampment the sun was
      shining pleasantly. The winter, after its final savage kick, had vanished
      and summer, crowding hard upon spring, was wooing the bluffs and hillsides
      on their southern exposures to don their summer robes of green. Not yet
      had the bluffs and hillsides quite yielded to the wooing, not yet had they
      donned the bright green apparel of summer, but there was the promise of
      summer's color gleaming through the neutral browns and grays of the poplar
      bluffs and the sunny hillsides. The crocuses with reckless abandon had
      sprung forth at the first warm kiss of the summer sun and stood bravely,
      gaily dancing in their purple and gray, till whole hillsides blushed for
      them. And the poplars, hesitating with dainty reserve, shivered in shy
      anticipation and waited for a surer call, still wearing their neutral
      tints, except where they stood sheltered by the thick spruces from the
      surly north wind. There they had boldly cast aside all prudery and were
      flirting in all their gallant trappings with the ardent summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing none of all this, but dimly conscious of the good of it, Cameron
      and his faithful attendant Jerry lay grimly watching through the poplars.
      Three days had passed since the raid, and as yet there was no sign at the
      Piegan camp of the returning raiders. Not for one hour had the camp
      remained unwatched. Just long enough to bury his new-made friend, the dead
      outlaw, did Cameron himself quit the post, leaving Jerry on guard
      meantime, and now he was back again, with his glasses searching every
      corner of the Piegan camp and watching every movement. There was upon his
      face a look that filled with joy his watchful companion, a look that
      proclaimed his set resolve that when Eagle Feather and his young men
      should appear in camp there would speedily be swift and decisive action.
      For three days his keen eyes had looked forth through the delicate
      green-brown screen of poplar upon the doings of the Piegans, the Mounted
      Police meantime ostentatiously beating up the Blood Reserve with unwonted
      threats of vengeance for the raiders, the bruit of which had spread
      through all the reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do anything rash,&rdquo; the Superintendent had admonished, as Cameron
      appeared demanding three troopers and Jerry, with whom to execute
      vengeance upon those who had brought death to a gallant gentleman and his
      gallant steed, for both of whom there had sprung up in Cameron's heart a
      great and admiring affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Cameron had replied, &ldquo;nothing rash; we will do a little
      justice, that is all,&rdquo; but with so stern a face that the Superintendent
      had watched him away with some anxiety and had privately ordered a strong
      patrol to keep the Piegan camp under surveillance till Cameron had done
      his work. But there was no call for aid from any patrol, as it turned out;
      and before this bright summer morning had half passed away Cameron shut up
      his glasses, ready for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they are all in now, Jerry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will go down. Go and
      bring in the men. There is that devil Eagle Feather just riding in.&rdquo;
       Cameron's teeth went hard together on the name of the Chief, in whom the
      leniency of Police administration of justice had bred only a deeper
      treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within half an hour Cameron with his three troopers and Jerry rode
      jingling into the Piegan camp and disposed themselves at suitable points
      of vantage. Straight to the Chief's tent Cameron rode, and found Trotting
      Wolf standing at its door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want that cattle-thief, Eagle Feather,&rdquo; he announced in a clear, firm
      voice that rang through the encampment from end to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eagle Feather not here,&rdquo; was Trotting Wolf's sullen but disturbed reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf, I will waste no time on you,&rdquo; said Cameron, drawing his
      gun. &ldquo;I take Eagle Feather or you. Make your choice and quick about it!&rdquo;
       There was in Cameron's voice a ring of such compelling command that
      Trotting Wolf weakened visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not where Eagle Feather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt there!&rdquo; cried Cameron to an Indian who was seen to be slinking away
      from the rear of the line of tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian broke into a run. Like a whirlwind Cameron was on his trail and
      before he had gained the cover of the woods had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Cameron again as he reached the Indian's side. The Indian
      stopped and drew a knife. &ldquo;You would, eh? Take that, will you?&rdquo; Leaning
      down over his horse's neck Cameron struck the Indian with the butt of his
      gun. Before he could rise the three constables in a converging rush were
      upon him and had him handcuffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, where is Eagle Feather?&rdquo; cried Cameron in a furious voice,
      riding his horse into the crowd that had gathered thick about him. &ldquo;Ah, I
      see you,&rdquo; he cried, touching his horse with his heel as on the farther
      edge of the crowd he caught sight of his man. With a single bound his
      horse was within touch of the shrinking Indian. &ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo;
       cried Cameron, springing from his horse and striding to the Chief. &ldquo;Put up
      your hands!&rdquo; he said, covering him with his gun. &ldquo;Quick, you dog!&rdquo; he
      added, as Eagle Feather stood irresolute before him. Upon the uplifted
      hands Cameron slipped the handcuffs. &ldquo;Come with me, you cattle-thief,&rdquo; he
      said, seizing him by the gaudy handkerchief that adorned his neck, and
      giving him a quick jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf,&rdquo; said Cameron in a terrible voice, wheeling furiously upon
      the Chief, &ldquo;this cattle-thieving of your band must stop. I want the six
      men who were in that cattle-raid, or you come with me. Speak quick!&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Gar!&rdquo; said Jerry, hugging himself in his delight, to the trooper who
      was in charge of the first Indian. &ldquo;Look lak' he tak' de whole camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Jerry, it looks so to me, too! He has got the fear of death on
      these chappies. Look at his face. He looks like the very devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Cameron's face was gray, with purple blotches, and distorted
      with passion, his eyes were blazing with fury, his manner one of reckless
      savage abandon. There was but little delay. The rumors of vengeance stored
      up for the raiders, the paralyzing effect of the failure of the raid, the
      condemnation of a guilty conscience, but above all else the overmastering
      rage of Cameron, made anything like resistance simply impossible. In a
      very few minutes Cameron had his prisoners in line and was riding to the
      Fort, where he handed them over to the Superintendent for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      That business done, he found his patrol-work pressing upon him with a
      greater insistence than ever, for the runners from the half-breeds and the
      Northern Indians were daily arriving at the reserves bearing reports of
      rebel victories of startling magnitude. But even without any exaggeration
      tales grave enough were being carried from lip to lip throughout the
      Indian tribes. Small wonder that the irresponsible young Chiefs, chafing
      under the rule of the white man and thirsting for the mad rapture of
      fight, were straining almost to the breaking point the authority of the
      cooler older heads, so that even that subtle redskin statesman, Crowfoot,
      began to fear for his own position in the Blackfeet confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days went on the Superintendent at Macleod, whose duty it was to
      hold in statu quo that difficult country running up into the mountains and
      down to the American boundary-line, found his task one that would have
      broken a less cool-headed and stout-hearted officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation in which he found himself seemed almost to invite
      destruction. On the eighteenth of March he had sent the best of his men,
      some twenty-five of them, with his Inspector, to join the Alberta Field
      Force at Calgary, whence they made that famous march to Edmonton of over
      two hundred miles in four and a half marching days. From Calgary, too, had
      gone a picked body of Police with Superintendent Strong and his scouts as
      part of the Alberta Field Force under General Strange. Thus it came that
      by the end of April the Superintendent at Fort Macleod had under his
      command only a handful of his trained Police, supported by two or three
      companies of Militia&mdash;who, with all their ardor, were unskilled in
      plain-craft, strange to the country, new to war, ignorant of the habits
      and customs and temper of the Indians with whom they were supposed to deal&mdash;to
      hold the vast extent of territory under his charge, with its little
      scattered hamlets of settlers, safe in the presence of the largest and
      most warlike of the Indian tribes in Western Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day the strain became more intense. A crisis appeared to be reached
      when the news came that on the twenty-fourth of April General Middleton
      had met a check at Fish Creek, which, though not specially serious in
      itself, revealed the possibilities of the rebel strategy and gave heart to
      the enemy immediately engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, though Fish Creek was no great fight, the rumor of it ran through the
      Western reserves like red fire through prairie-grass, blowing almost into
      flame the war-spirit of the young braves of the Bloods, Piegans and
      Sarcees and even of the more stable Blackfeet. Three days after that
      check, the news of it was humming through every tepee in the West, and for
      a week or more it took all the cool courage and steady nerve
      characteristic of the Mounted Police to enable them to ride without flurry
      or hurry their daily patrols through the reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crisis it was that the Superintendent at Macleod gathered together
      such of his officers and non-commissioned officers as he could in council
      at Fort Calgary, to discuss the situation and to plan for all possible
      emergencies. The full details of the Fish Creek affair had just come in.
      They were disquieting enough, although the Superintendent made light of
      them. On the wall of the barrack-room where the council was gathered there
      hung a large map of the Territories. The Superintendent, a man of small
      oratorical powers, undertook to set forth the disposition of the various
      forces now operating in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you observe the main line running west from Regina to the mountains,
      some five hundred and fifty miles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And here, roughly, two
      hundred and fifty miles north, is the northern boundary line of our
      settlements, Prince Albert at the east, Battleford at the center, Edmonton
      at the west, each of these points the center of a country ravaged by
      half-breeds and bands of Indians. To each of these points
      relief-expeditions have been sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This line represents the march of Commissioner Irvine from Regina to
      Prince Albert&mdash;a most remarkable march that was too, gentlemen,
      nearly three hundred miles over snow-bound country in about seven days.
      That march will be remembered, I venture to say. The Commissioner still
      holds Prince Albert, and we may rely upon it will continue to hold it safe
      against any odds. Meantime he is scouting the country round about,
      preventing Indians from reinforcing the enemy in any large numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, to the west is Battleford, which holds the central position and is
      the storm-center of the rebellion at present. This line shows the march of
      Colonel Otter with Superintendent Herchmer from Swift Current to that
      point. We have just heard that Colonel Otter has arrived at Battleford and
      has raised the siege. But large bands of Indians are in the vicinity of
      Battleford and the situation there is extremely critical. I understand
      that old Oo-pee-too-korah-han-apee-wee-yin&mdash;&rdquo; the Superintendent
      prided himself upon his mastery of Indian names and ran off this
      polysyllabic cognomen with the utmost facility&mdash;&ldquo;the Pond-maker, or
      Pound-maker as he has come to be called, is in the neighborhood. He is not
      a bad fellow, but he is a man of unusual ability, far more able than of
      the Willow Crees, Beardy, as he is called, though not so savage, and he
      has a large and compact body of Indians under him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here straight north from us some two hundred miles is Edmonton, the
      center of a very wide district sparsely settled, with a strong half-breed
      element in the immediate neighborhood and Big Bear and Little Pine
      commanding large bodies of Indians ravaging the country round about.
      Inspector Griesbach is in command of this district, located at Fort
      Saskatchewan, which is in close touch with Edmonton. General Strange,
      commanding the Alberta Field Force and several companies of Militia,
      together with our own men under Superintendent Strong and Inspector
      Dickson, are on the way to relieve this post. Inspector Dickson, I
      understand, has successfully made the crossing of the Red Deer with his
      nine pr. gun, a quite remarkable feat I assure you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, gentlemen, you see the position in which we are placed in this
      section of the country. From the Cypress Hills here away to the southeast,
      westward to the mountains and down to the boundary-line, you have a series
      of reserves almost completely denuded of Police supervision. True, we are
      fortunate in having at the Blackfoot Crossing, at Fort Calgary and at Fort
      Macleod, companies of Militia; but the very presence of these troops
      incites the Indians, and in some ways is a continual source of unrest
      among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day runners from the North and East come to our reserves with
      extraordinary tales of rebel victories. This Fish Creek business has had a
      tremendous influence upon the younger element. On every reserve there are
      scores of young braves eager to rise. What a general uprising would mean
      you know, or think you know. An Indian war of extermination is a horrible
      possibility. The question before us all is&mdash;what is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a period of conversation the Superintendent summed up the results of
      the discussion in a few short sentences:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems, gentlemen, there is not much more to be done than what we are
      already doing. But first of all I need not say that we must keep our
      nerve. I do not believe any Indian will see any sign of doubt or fear in
      the face of any member of this Force. Our patrols must be regularly and
      carefully done. There are a lot of things which we must not see, a certain
      amount of lawbreaking which we must not notice. Avoid on every possible
      occasion pushing things to extremes; but where it is necessary to act we
      must act with promptitude and fearlessness, as Mr. Cameron here did at the
      Piegan Reserve a week or so ago. I mention this because I consider that
      action of Cameron's a typically fine piece of Police work. We must keep on
      good terms with the Chiefs, tell them what good news there is to tell. We
      must intercept every runner possible. Arrest them and bring them to the
      barracks. The situation is grave, but not hopeless. Great responsibilities
      rest upon us, gentlemen. I do not believe that we shall fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little company broke up with resolute and grim determination stamped
      on every face. There would be no weakening at any spot where a Mounted
      Policeman was on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cameron, just a moment,&rdquo; said the Superintendent as he was passing out.
      &ldquo;Sit down. You were quite right in that Eagle Feather matter. You did the
      right thing in pushing that hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I somehow felt I could do it, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron simply. &ldquo;I had the
      feeling in my bones that we could have taken the whole camp that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent nodded. &ldquo;I understand. And that is the way we should
      feel. But don't do anything rash this week. This is a week of crisis. If
      any further reverse should happen to our troops it will be extremely
      difficult, if indeed possible, to hold back the younger braves. If there
      should be a rising&mdash;which may God forbid&mdash;my plan then would be
      to back right on to the Blackfeet Reserve. If old Crowfoot keeps steady&mdash;and
      with our presence to support him I believe he would&mdash;we could hold
      things safe for a while. But, Cameron, that Sioux devil Copperhead must be
      got rid of. It is he that is responsible for this restless spirit among
      the younger Chiefs. He has been in the East, you say, for the last three
      weeks, but he will soon be back. His runners are everywhere. His work lies
      here, and the only hope for the rebellion lies here, and he knows it. My
      scouts inform me that there is something big immediately on. A powwow is
      arranged somewhere before final action. I have reason to suspect that if
      we sustain another reverse and if the minor Chiefs from all the reserves
      come to an agreement, Crowfoot will yield. That is the game that the Sioux
      is working on now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that quite well, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;Copperhead has captured
      practically all the minor Chiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The checking of that big cattle-run, Cameron, was a mighty good stroke
      for us. You did that magnificently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Cameron firmly. &ldquo;We owe that to Raven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, we do owe a good deal to&mdash;to&mdash;that&mdash;to Raven.
      Fine fellow gone wrong. Yes, we owe a lot to him, but we owe a lot to you
      as well, Cameron. I am not saying you will ever get any credit for it, but&mdash;well&mdash;who
      cares so long as the thing is done? But this Sioux must be got at all
      costs&mdash;at all costs, Cameron, remember. I have never asked you to
      push this thing to the limit, but now at all costs, dead or alive, that
      Sioux must be got rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have potted him several times,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;but did not
      wish to push matters to extremes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. Quite right. That has been our policy hitherto, but now
      things have reached such a crisis that we can take no further chances. The
      Sioux must be eliminated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; said Cameron, and a new purpose shaped itself in his
      heart. At all costs he would get the Sioux, alive if possible, dead if
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly the first thing was to uncover his tracks, and with this intention
      Cameron proceeded to the Blackfeet Reserve, riding with Jerry down the Bow
      River from Fort Calgary, until, as the sun was setting on an early May
      evening, he came in sight of the Blackfoot Crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not wishing to visit the Militia camp at that point, and desiring to
      explore the approaches of the Blackfeet Reserve with as little ostentation
      as possible, he sent Jerry on with the horses, with instructions to meet
      him later on in the evening on the outside of the Blackfeet camp, and took
      a side trail on foot leading to the reserve through a coulee. Through the
      bottom of the coulee ran a little stream whose banks were packed tight
      with alders, willows and poplars. Following the trail to where it crossed
      the stream, Cameron left it for the purpose of quenching his thirst, and
      proceeded up-stream some little way from the usual crossing. Lying there
      prone upon his face he caught the sound of hoofs, and, peering through the
      alders, he saw a line of Indians riding down the opposite bank. Burying
      his head among the tangled alders and hardly breathing, he watched them
      one by one cross the stream not more than thirty yards away and clamber up
      the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something doing here, sure enough,&rdquo; he said to himself as he noted their
      faces. Three of them he knew, Red Crow of the Bloods, Trotting Wolf of the
      Piegans, Running Stream of the Blackfeet, then came three others unknown
      to Cameron, and last in the line Cameron was startled to observe
      Copperhead himself, while close at his side could be seen the slim figure
      of his son. As the Sioux passed by Cameron's hiding-place he paused and
      looked steadily down into the alders for a moment or two, then rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved yourself that time, old man,&rdquo; said Cameron as the Sioux
      disappeared, following the others up the trail. &ldquo;We will see just which
      trail you take,&rdquo; he continued, following them at a safe distance and
      keeping himself hidden by the brush till they reached the open and
      disappeared over the hill. Swiftly Cameron ran to the top, and, lying
      prone among the prairie grass, watched them for some time as they took the
      trail that ran straight westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarcee Reserve more than likely,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;If Jerry were
      only here! But he is not, so I must let them go in the meantime. Later,
      however, we shall come up with you, gentlemen. And now for old Crowfoot
      and with no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had only a couple of miles to go and in a few minutes he had reached
      the main trail from the Militia camp at the Crossing. In the growing
      darkness he could not discern whether Jerry had passed with the horses or
      not, so he pushed on rapidly to the appointed place of meeting and there
      found Jerry waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Jerry!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Copperhead is back. I have just seen him and
      his son with Red Crow, Trotting Wolf and Running Stream. There were three
      others&mdash;Sioux I think they are; at any rate I did not know them. They
      passed me in the coulee and took the Sarcee trail. Now what do you think
      is up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry pondered. &ldquo;Come from Crowfoot, heh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the reserve here anyway,&rdquo; answered Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting Wolf beeg Chief&mdash;Red Crow beeg Chief&mdash;ver' bad! ver'
      bad! Dunno me&mdash;look somet'ing&mdash;beeg powwow mebbe. Ver' bad! Ver'
      bad! Go Sarcee Reserve, heh?&rdquo; Again Jerry pondered. &ldquo;Come from h'east&mdash;by
      Blood&mdash;Piegan&mdash;den Blackfeet&mdash;go Sarcee. What dey do? Where
      go den?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the question, Jerry,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sout' to Weegwam? No, nord to Ghost Reever&mdash;Manitou Rock&mdash;dunno&mdash;mebbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Jerry, I believe you may be right. I don't think they would go
      to the Wigwam&mdash;we caught them there once&mdash;nor to the canyon.
      What about this Ghost River? I don't know the trail. Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nord from Bow Reever by Kananaskis half day to Ghost Reever&mdash;bad
      trail&mdash;small leetle reever&mdash;ver' stony&mdash;ver' cold&mdash;beeg
      tree wit' long beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long beard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;long, long gray moss lak' beard&mdash;ver' strange place dat&mdash;from
      Ghost Reever west one half day to beeg Manitou Rock&mdash;no trail. Beeg
      medicine-dance dere&mdash;see heem once long tam' 'go&mdash;leetle boy me&mdash;beeg

      go when mak' beeg tam'&mdash;beeg medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see if I get you, Jerry. A bad trail leads half a day north from
      the Bow at Kananaskis to Ghost River, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then up the Ghost River westward through the bearded trees half a day to
      the Manitou Rock? Is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Jerry nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I know the rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beeg rock,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Beeg dat tree,&rdquo; pointing to a tall poplar, &ldquo;and
      cut straight down lak some knife&mdash;beeg rock&mdash;black rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;What I want to know just now is does Crowfoot
      know of this thing? I fancy he must. I am going in to see him. Copperhead
      has just come from the reserve. He has Running Stream with him. It is
      possible, just possible, that he may not have seen Crowfoot. This I shall
      find out. Now, Jerry, you must follow Copperhead, find out where he has
      gone and all you can about this business, and meet me where the trail
      reaches the Ghost River. Call in at Fort Calgary. Take a trooper with you
      to look after the horses. I shall follow you to-morrow. If you are not at
      the Ghost River I shall go right on&mdash;that is if I see any signs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon! Good!&rdquo; said Jerry. And without further word he slipped on to his
      horse and disappeared into the darkness, taking the cross-trail through
      the coulee by which Cameron had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowfoot's camp showed every sign of the organization and discipline of a
      master spirit. The tents and houses in which his Indians lived were
      extended along both sides of a long valley flanked at both ends by
      poplar-bluffs. At the bottom of the valley there was a series of &ldquo;sleughs&rdquo;
       or little lakes, affording good grazing and water for the herds of cattle
      and ponies that could be seen everywhere upon the hillsides. At a point
      farthest from the water and near to a poplar-bluff stood Crowfoot's house.
      At the first touch of summer, however, Crowfoot's household had moved out
      from their dwelling, after the manner of the Indians, and had taken up
      their lodging in a little group of tents set beside the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward this little group of tents Cameron rode at an easy lope. He found
      Crowfoot alone beside his fire, except for the squaws that were cleaning
      up after the evening meal and the papooses and older children rolling
      about on the grass. As Cameron drew near, all vanished, except Crowfoot
      and a youth about seventeen years of age, whose strongly marked features
      and high, fearless bearing proclaimed him Crowfoot's son. Dismounting,
      Cameron dropped the reins over his horse's head and with a word of
      greeting to the Chief sat down by the fire. Crowfoot acknowledged his
      salutation with a suspicious look and grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice night, Crowfoot,&rdquo; said Cameron cheerfully. &ldquo;Good weather for the
      grass, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Crowfoot gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron pulled out his tobacco pouch and passed it to the Chief. With an
      air of indescribable condescension Crowfoot took the pouch, knocked the
      ashes from his pipe, filled it from the pouch and handed it back to the
      owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy smoke?&rdquo; inquired Cameron, holding out the pouch toward the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Crowfoot with a slight relaxing of his face. &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;too
      small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad stood like a statue, and, except for a slight stiffening of his
      tall lithe figure, remained absolutely motionless, after the Indian
      manner. For some time they smoked in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting cold,&rdquo; said Cameron at length, as he kicked the embers of the
      fire together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowfoot spoke to his son and the lad piled wood on the fire till it
      blazed high, then, at a sign from his father, he disappeared into the
      tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! That is better,&rdquo; said Cameron, stretching out his hands toward the
      fire and disposing himself so that the old Chief's face should be set
      clearly in its light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Police ride hard these days?&rdquo; said Crowfoot in his own language,
      after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sometimes,&rdquo; replied Cameron carelessly, &ldquo;when cattle-thieves ride
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; inquired Crowfoot innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, some Indians forget all that the Police have done for them, and like
      coyotes steal upon the cattle at night and drive them over cut-banks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; inquired Crowfoot again, apparently much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Cameron, fully aware that he was giving the old Chief no
      news, &ldquo;Eagle Feather will be much wiser when he rides over the plains
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; ejaculated the Chief in agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Eagle Feather,&rdquo; continued Cameron, &ldquo;is not the worst Indian. He is no
      good, only a little boy who does what he is told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; inquired Crowfoot with childlike simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is an old squaw serving his Chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; again inquired Crowfoot, moving his pipe from his mouth in his
      apparent anxiety to learn the name of this unknown master of Eagle
      Feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onawata, the Sioux, is a great Chief,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowfoot grunted his indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes all the little Chiefs, Blood, Piegan, Sarcee, Blackfeet obey
      him,&rdquo; said Cameron in a scornful voice, shading his face from the fire
      with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Crowfoot made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has left this country for a while?&rdquo; continued Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowfoot grunted acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother has not seen this Sioux for some weeks?&rdquo; Again Cameron's hand
      shaded his face from the fire while his eyes searched the old Chief's
      impassive countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Crowfoot. &ldquo;Not for many days. Onawata bad man&mdash;make much
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The big war is going on good,&rdquo; said Cameron, abruptly changing the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; inquired Crowfoot, looking up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;At Fish Creek the half-breeds and Indians had a good
      chance to wipe out General Middleton's column.&rdquo; And he proceeded to give a
      graphic account of the rebels' opportunity at that unfortunate affair.
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the half-breeds and Indians have no Chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Chief,&rdquo; agreed Crowfoot with emphasis, his old eyes gleaming in the
      firelight. &ldquo;No Chief,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Where Big Bear&mdash;Little Pine&mdash;Kah-mee-yes-too-waegs
      and Oo-pee-too-korah-han-ap-ee-wee-yin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;here, there, everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! No big Chief,&rdquo; grunted Crowfoot in disgust. &ldquo;One big Chief make all
      Indians one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed worth while to Cameron to take a full hour from his precious
      time to describe fully the operations of the troops and to make clear to
      the old warrior the steady advances which the various columns were making,
      the points they had relieved and the ultimate certainty of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six thousand men now in the West,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;besides the Police. And
      ten thousand more waiting to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Crowfoot was evidently much impressed and was eager to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; said Cameron, rising. &ldquo;Where is Running Stream?&rdquo; he
      asked, suddenly facing Crowfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Running Stream he go hunt&mdash;t'ree day&mdash;not come back,&rdquo;
       answered Crowfoot quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron sat down again by the fire, poked up the embers till the blaze
      mounted high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crowfoot,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;this day Onawata was in this camp and spoke
      with you. Wait!&rdquo; he said, putting up his hand as the old Chief was about
      to speak. &ldquo;This evening he rode away with Running Stream, Red Crow,
      Trotting Wolf. The Sioux for many days has been leading about your young
      men like dogs on a string. To-day he has put the string round the necks of
      Red Crow, Running Stream, Trotting Wolf. I did not think he could lead
      Crowfoot too like a little dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said again as Crowfoot rose to his feet in indignation.
      &ldquo;Listen! The Police will get that Sioux. And the Police will take the
      Chiefs that he led round like little dogs and send them away. The Great
      Mother cannot have men as Chiefs whom she cannot trust. For many years the
      Police have protected the Indians. It was Crowfoot himself who once said
      when the treaty was being made&mdash;Crowfoot will remember&mdash;'If the
      Police had not come to the country where would we all be now? Bad men and
      whisky were killing us so fast that very few indeed of us would have been
      left to-day. The Police have protected us as the feathers of the bird
      protect it from the frosts of winter.' This is what Crowfoot said to the
      Great Mother's Councilor when he made a treaty with the Great Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Cameron rose to his feet and stood facing the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Crowfoot a traitor? Does he give his hand and draw it back again? It
      is not good that, when trouble comes, the Indians should join the enemies
      of the Police and of the Great Mother across the sea. These enemies will
      be scattered like dust before the wind. Does Crowfoot think when the
      leaves have fallen from the trees this year there will be any enemies
      left? Bah! This Sioux dog does not know the Great Mother, nor her
      soldiers, nor her Police. Crowfoot knows. Why does he talk to the enemies
      of the Great Mother and of his friends the Police? What does Crowfoot say?
      I go to-night to take Onawata. Already my men are upon his trail. Where
      does Crowfoot stand? With Onawata and the little Chiefs he leads around or
      with the Great Mother and the Police? Speak! I am waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old Chief was deeply stirred. For some moments while Cameron was
      speaking he had been eagerly seeking an opportunity to reply, but
      Cameron's passionate torrent of words prevented him breaking in without
      discourtesy. When Cameron ceased, however, the old Chief stretched out his
      hand and in his own language began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many years ago the Police came to this country. My people then were poor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the sound of a galloping horse was heard, mingled with the
      loud cries of its rider. Crowfoot paused and stood intently listening.
      Cameron could get no meaning from the shouting. From every tent men came
      running forth and from the houses along the trail on every hand, till
      before the horse had gained Crowfoot's presence there had gathered about
      the Chief's fire a considerable crowd of Indians, whose numbers were
      momentarily augmented by men from the tents and houses up and down the
      trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In calm and dignified silence the old Chief waited the rider's word. He
      was an Indian runner and he bore an important message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismounting, the runner stood, struggling to recover his breath and to
      regain sufficient calmness to deliver his message in proper form to the
      great Chief of the Blackfeet confederacy. While he stood thus struggling
      with himself Cameron took the opportunity to closely scrutinize his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Sarcee,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I remember him&mdash;an impudent cur.&rdquo; He moved
      quietly toward his horse, drew the reins up over his head, and, leading
      him back toward the fire, took his place beside Crowfoot again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sarcee had begun his tale, speaking under intense excitement which he
      vainly tried to control. He delivered his message. Such was the rapidity
      and incoherence of his speech, however, that Cameron could make nothing of
      it. The effect upon the crowd was immediate and astounding. On every side
      rose wild cries of fierce exultation, while at Cameron angry looks flashed
      from every eye. Old Crowfoot alone remained quiet, calm, impassive, except
      for the fierce gleaming of his steady eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the runner had delivered his message he held up his hand and spoke
      but a single word. Immediately there was silence as of the grave. Nothing
      was heard, not even the breathing of the Indians close about him. In
      sharp, terse sentences the old Chief questioned the runner, who replied at
      first eagerly, then, as the questions proceeded, with some hesitation.
      Finally, with a wave of the hand Crowfoot dismissed him and stood silently
      pondering for some moments. Then he turned to his people and said with
      quiet and impressive dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a matter for the Council. To-morrow we will discuss it.&rdquo; Then
      turning to Cameron he said in a low voice and with grave courtesy, &ldquo;It is
      wise that my brother should go while the trails are open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trails are always open to the Great Mother's Mounted Police,&rdquo; said
      Cameron, looking the old Chief full in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowfoot stood silent, evidently thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is right that my brother should know,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;what the
      runner tells,&rdquo; and in his deep guttural voice there was a ring of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news is always welcome,&rdquo; said Cameron, as he coolly pulled out his
      pipe and offered his pouch once more to Crowfoot, who, however, declined
      to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white soldiers have attacked the Indians and have been driven back,&rdquo;
       said Crowfoot with a keen glance at Cameron's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Cameron, smiling. &ldquo;What Indians? What white soldiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soldiers that marched to Battleford. They went against
      Oo-pee-too-korah-han-ap-ee-wee-yin and the Indians did not run away.&rdquo; No
      words could describe the tone and attitude of exultant and haughty pride
      with which the old Chief delivered this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crowfoot,&rdquo; said Cameron with deliberate emphasis, &ldquo;it was Colonel Otter
      and Superintendent Herchmer of the Mounted Police that went north to
      Battleford. You do not know Colonel Otter, but you do know Superintendent
      Herchmer. Tell me, would Superintendent Herchmer and the Police run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The runner tells that the white soldiers ran away,&rdquo; said Crowfoot
      stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the runner lies!&rdquo; Cameron's voice rang out loud and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift as a lightning flash the Sarcee sprang at Cameron, knife in hand,
      crying in the Blackfeet tongue that terrible cry so long dreaded by
      settlers in the Western States of America, &ldquo;Death to the white man!&rdquo;
       Without apparently moving a muscle, still holding by the mane of his
      horse, Cameron met the attack with a swift and well-placed kick which
      caught the Indian's right wrist and flung his knife high in the air.
      Following up the kick, Cameron took a single step forward and met the
      murderous Sarcee with a straight left-hand blow on the jaw that landed the
      Indian across the fire and deposited him kicking amid the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately there was a quick rush toward the white man, but the rush
      halted before two little black barrels with two hard, steady, gray eyes
      gleaming behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crowfoot!&rdquo; said Cameron sharply. &ldquo;I hold ten dead Indians in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a single stride Crowfoot was at Cameron's side. A single sharp stern
      word of command he uttered and the menacing Indians slunk back into the
      shadows, but growling like angry beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it wise to anger my young men?&rdquo; said Crowfoot in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it wise,&rdquo; replied Cameron sternly, &ldquo;to allow mad dogs to run loose? We
      kill such mad dogs in my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Crowfoot with a shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;Let him die!&rdquo; Then
      in a lower voice he added earnestly, &ldquo;It would be good to take the trail
      before my young men can catch their horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going, Crowfoot,&rdquo; said Cameron, stooping to light his pipe at
      the fire. &ldquo;Good-night. Remember what I have said.&rdquo; And Cameron cantered
      away with both hands low before him and guiding his broncho with his
      knees, and so rode easily till safely beyond the line of the reserve. Once
      out of the reserve he struck his spurs hard into his horse and sent him
      onward at headlong pace toward the Militia camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes after his arrival at the camp every soldier was in his place
      ready to strike, and so remained all night, with pickets thrown far out
      listening with ears attent for the soft pad of moccasined feet.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LAST PATROL
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was still early morning when Cameron rode into the barrack-yard at Fort
      Calgary. To the Sergeant in charge, the Superintendent of Police having
      departed to Macleod, he reported the events of the preceding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about that rumor, Sergeant?&rdquo; he inquired after he had told his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had the details yesterday,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant. &ldquo;Colonel Otter
      and a column of some three hundred men with three guns went out after
      Pound-maker. The Indians were apparently strongly posted and could not be
      dislodged, and I guess our men were glad to get out of the scrape as
      easily as they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; cried Cameron, more to himself than to the officer, &ldquo;what
      will this mean to us here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord only knows!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my business presses all the more,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;I'm going after
      this Sioux. Jerry is already on his trail. I suppose you cannot let me
      have three or four men? There is liable to be trouble and we cannot afford
      to make a mess of this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry came in last night asking for a man,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, &ldquo;but I
      could not spare one. However, we will do our best and send you on the very
      first men that come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send on half a dozen to-morrow at the very latest,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;I
      shall rely upon you. Let me give you my trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left a plan of the Ghost River Trail with the Sergeant and rode to look
      up Dr. Martin. He found the doctor still in bed and wrathful at being
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Cameron,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;what in thunder do you mean by roaming
      round this way at night and waking up Christian people out of their
      sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, old boy,&rdquo; replied Cameron, &ldquo;but my business is rather important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then while the doctor sat and shivered in his night clothes upon the
      side of the bed Cameron gave him in detail the history of the previous
      evening and outlined his plan for the capture of the Sioux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Martin listened intently, noting the various points and sketching an
      outline of the trail as Cameron described it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted you to know, Martin, in case anything happened. For, well, you
      know how it is with my wife just now. A shock might kill her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor growled an indistinct reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, old chap. Good-by,&rdquo; said Cameron, pressing his hand. &ldquo;This I
      feel is my last go with old Copperhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your last go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't be alarmed,&rdquo; he replied lightly. &ldquo;I am going to get him this
      time. There will be no trifling henceforth. Well, good-by, I am off. By
      the way, the Sergeant at the barracks has promised to send on half a dozen
      men to-morrow to back me up. You might just keep him in mind of that, for
      things are so pressing here that he might quite well imagine that he could
      not spare the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is rather better,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;The Sergeant will send those
      men all right, or I will know the reason why. Hope you get your game.
      Good-by, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A day's ride brought Cameron to Kananaskis, where the Sun Dance Trail ends
      on one side of the Bow River and the Ghost River Trail begins on the
      other. There he found signs to indicate that Jerry was before him on his
      way to the Manitou Rock. As Cameron was preparing to camp for the night
      there came over him a strong but unaccountable presentiment of approaching
      evil, an irresistible feeling that he ought to press forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! I will be seeing spooks next!&rdquo; he said impatiently to himself. &ldquo;I
      suppose it is the Highlander in me that is seeing visions and dreaming
      dreams. I must eat, however, no matter what is going to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his horse saddled, but removing the bridle, he gave him his feed
      of oats, then he boiled his tea and made his own supper. As he was eating
      the feeling grew more strongly upon him that he should not camp but go
      forward at once. At the same time he made the discovery that the weariness
      that had almost overpowered him during the last half-hour of his ride had
      completely vanished. Hence, with the feeling of half contemptuous anger at
      himself for yielding to his presentiment, he packed up his kit again,
      bridled his horse, and rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail was indeed, as Jerry said, &ldquo;no trail.&rdquo; It was rugged with broken
      rocks and cumbered with fallen trees, and as it proceeded became more
      indistinct. His horse, too, from sheer weariness, for he had already done
      his full day's journey, was growing less sure footed and so went stumbling
      noisily along. Cameron began to regret his folly in yielding to a mere
      unreasoning imagination and he resolved to spend the night at the first
      camping-ground that should offer. The light of the long spring day was
      beginning to fade from the sky and in the forest the deep shadows were
      beginning to gather. Still no suitable camping-ground presented itself and
      Cameron stubbornly pressed forward through the forest that grew denser and
      more difficult at every step. After some hours of steady plodding the
      trees began to be sensibly larger, the birch and poplar gave place to
      spruce and pine and the underbrush almost entirely disappeared. The trail,
      too, became better, winding between the large trees which, with clean
      trunks, stood wide apart and arranged themselves in stately high-arched
      aisles and long corridors. From the lofty branches overhead the gray moss
      hung in long streamers, as Jerry had said, giving to the trees an ancient
      and weird appearance. Along these silent, solemn, gray-festooned aisles
      and corridors Cameron rode with an uncanny sensation that unseen eyes were
      peering out upon him from those dim and festooned corridors on either
      side. Impatiently he strove to shake off the feeling, but in vain. At
      length, forced by the growing darkness, he decided to camp, when through
      the shadowy and silent forest there came to his ears the welcome sound of
      running water. It was to Cameron like the sound of a human voice. He
      almost called aloud to the running stream as to a friend. It was the Ghost
      River.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he had reached the water and after picketing his horse
      some little distance down the stream and away from the trail, he rolled
      himself in his blanket to sleep. The moon rising above the high tree-tops
      filled the forest aisles with a soft unearthly light. As his eye followed
      down the long dim aisles there grew once more upon him the feeling that he
      was being watched by unseen eyes. Vainly he cursed himself for his folly.
      He could not sleep. A twig broke near him. He lay still listening with
      every nerve taut. He fancied he could hear soft feet about him and
      stealing near. With his two guns in hand he sat bolt upright. Straight
      before him and not more than ten feet away the form of an Indian was
      plainly to be seen. A slight sound to his right drew his eyes in that
      direction. There, too, stood the silent form of an Indian, on his left
      also an Indian. Suddenly from behind him a deep, guttural voice spoke,
      &ldquo;Look this way!&rdquo; He turned sharply and found himself gazing into a
      rifle-barrel a few feet from his face. &ldquo;Now look back!&rdquo; said the voice. He
      glanced to right and left, only to find rifles leveled at him from every
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White man put down his guns on ground!&rdquo; said the same guttural voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian speak no more,&rdquo; said the voice in a deep growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron put his guns down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron obeyed. Out from behind the Indian with the leveled rifle glided
      another Indian form. It was Copperhead. Two more Indians appeared with
      him. All thought of resistance passed from Cameron's mind. It would mean
      instant death, and, what to Cameron was worse than death, the certain
      failure of his plans. While he lived he still had hope. Besides, there
      would be the Police next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With savage, cruel haste Copperhead bound his hands behind his back and as
      a further precaution threw a cord about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said, giving the cord a quick jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperhead,&rdquo; said Cameron through his clenched teeth, &ldquo;you will one day
      wish you had never done this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No speak!&rdquo; said Copperhead gruffly, jerking the cord so heavily as almost
      to throw Cameron off his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the night Cameron stumbled on with his captors, Copperhead in
      front and the others following. Half dead with sleeplessness and blind
      with rage he walked on as if in a hideous nightmare, mechanically watching
      the feet of the Indian immediately in front of him and thus saving himself
      many a cruel fall and a more cruel jerking of the cord about his neck, for
      such was Copperhead's method of lifting him to his feet when he fell. It
      seemed to him as if the night would never pass or the journey end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the throbbing of the Indian drum fell upon his ears. It was to
      him a welcome sound. Nothing could be much more agonizing than what he was
      at present enduring. As they approached the Indian camp one of his captors
      raised a wild, wailing cry which resounded through the forest with an
      unearthly sound. Never had such a cry fallen upon Cameron's ears. It was
      the old-time cry of the Indian warriors announcing that they were
      returning in triumph bringing their captives with them. The drum-beat
      ceased. Again the cry was raised, when from the Indian encampment came in
      reply a chorus of similar cries followed by a rush of braves to meet the
      approaching warriors and to welcome them and their captives.
    </p>
    <p>
      With loud and discordant exultation straight into the circle of the
      firelight cast from many fires Copperhead and his companions marched their
      captive. On every side naked painted Indians to the number of several
      score crowded in tumultuous uproar. Not for many years had these Indians
      witnessed their ancient and joyous sport of baiting a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cameron came into the clear light of the fire instantly low murmurs ran
      round the crowd, for to many of them he was well known. Then silence fell
      upon them. His presence there was clearly a shock to many of them. To take
      prisoner one of the Mounted Police and to submit him to indignity stirred
      strange emotions in their hearts. The keen eye of Copperhead noted the
      sudden change of the mood of the Indians and immediately he gave orders to
      those who held Cameron in charge, with the result that they hurried him
      off and thrust him into a little low hut constructed of brush and open in
      front where, after tying his feet securely, they left him with an Indian
      on guard in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Cameron lay stupid with weariness and pain till his
      weariness overpowered his pain and he sank into sleep. He was recalled to
      consciousness by the sensation of something digging into his ribs. As he
      sat up half asleep a low &ldquo;hist!&rdquo; startled him wide awake. His heart leaped
      as he heard out of the darkness a whispered word, &ldquo;Jerry here.&rdquo; Cameron
      rolled over and came close against the little half-breed, bound as he was
      himself. Again came the &ldquo;hist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me all lak' youse'f,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;No spik any. Look out front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian on guard was eagerly looking and listening to what was going on
      before him beside the fire. At one side of the circle sat the Indians in
      council. Copperhead was standing and speaking to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he saying?&rdquo; said Cameron, his mouth close to Jerry's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He say dey keel us queeck. Indian no lak' keel. Dey scare Police get 'em.
      Copperhead he ver' mad. Say he keel us heemse'f&mdash;queeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again and again and with ever increasing vehemence Copperhead urged his
      views upon the hesitating Indians, well aware that by involving them in
      such a deed of blood he would irrevocably commit them to rebellion. But he
      was dealing with men well-nigh as subtle as himself, and for the very same
      reason as he pressed them to the deed they shrank back from it. They were
      not yet quite prepared to burn their bridges behind them. Indeed some of
      them suggested the wisdom of holding the prisoners as hostages in case of
      necessity arising in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Indians are here?&rdquo; whispered Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piegan, Sarcee, Blood,&rdquo; breathed Jerry. &ldquo;No Blackfeet come&mdash;not yet&mdash;Copperhead
      he look, look, look all yesterday for Blackfeet coming. Blackfeet come
      to-morrow mebbe&mdash;den Indian mak' beeg medicine. Copperhead he go meet
      Blackfeet dis day&mdash;he catch you&mdash;he go 'gain to-morrow mebbe&mdash;dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the discussion in the council was drawing to a climax. With the
      astuteness of a true leader Copperhead ceased to urge his view, and,
      unable to secure the best, wisely determined to content himself with the
      second-best. His vehement tone gave place to one of persuasion. Finally an
      agreement appeared to be reached by all. With one consent the council rose
      and with hands uplifted they all appeared to take some solemn oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they saying?&rdquo; whispered Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He say,&rdquo; replied Jerry, &ldquo;he go meet Blackfeet and when he bring 'em back
      den dey keel us sure t'ing. But,&rdquo; added Jerry with a cheerful giggle, &ldquo;he
      not keel 'em yet, by Gar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes they waited in silence, then they saw Copperhead with his
      bodyguard of Sioux disappear from the circle of the firelight into the
      shadows of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you go sleep,&rdquo; whispered Jerry. &ldquo;Me keep watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even before he had finished speaking Cameron had lain back upon the ground
      and in spite of the pain in his tightly bound limbs such was his utter
      exhaustion that he fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him but a moment when he was again awakened by the touch of a
      hand stealing over his face. The hand reached his lips and rested there,
      when he started up wide-awake. A soft hiss from the back of the hut
      arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No noise,&rdquo; said a soft guttural voice. Again the hand was thrust through
      the brush wall, this time bearing a knife. &ldquo;Cut string,&rdquo; whispered the
      voice, while the hand kept feeling for the thongs that bound Cameron's
      hands. In a few moments Cameron was free from his bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the knife,&rdquo; he whispered. It was placed in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you squaw,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;sick boy not forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell her,&rdquo; replied Cameron. &ldquo;She will never forget you.&rdquo; The boy
      laid his hand on Cameron's lips and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Jerry too was free. Slowly they wormed their way through the flimsy
      brush wall at the back, and, crouching low, looked about them. The camp
      was deep in sleep. The fires were smoldering in their ashes. Not an Indian
      was moving. Lying across the front of their little hut the sleeping form
      of their guard could be seen. The forest was still black behind them, but
      already there was in the paling stars the faint promise of the dawn.
      Hardly daring to breathe, they rose and stood looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No stir,&rdquo; said Jerry with his lips at Cameron's ear. He dropped on his
      hands and knees and began carefully to remove every twig from his path so
      that his feet might rest only upon the deep leafy mold of the forest.
      Carefully Cameron followed his example, and, working slowly and painfully,
      they gained the cover of the dark forest away from the circle of the
      firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had they reached that shelter when an Indian rose from beside a
      fire, raked the embers together, and threw some sticks upon it. As Cameron
      stood watching him, his heart-beat thumping in his ears, a rotten twig
      snapped under his feet. The Indian turned his face in their direction,
      and, bending forward, appeared to be listening intently. Instantly Jerry,
      stooping down, made a scrambling noise in the leaves, ending with a thump
      upon the ground. Immediately the Indian relaxed his listening attitude,
      satisfied that a rabbit was scurrying through the forest upon his own
      errand bent. Rigidly silent they stood, watching him till long after he
      had lain down again in his place, then once more they began their painful
      advance, clearing treacherous twigs from every place where their feet
      should rest. Fortunately for their going the forest here was largely free
      from underbrush. Working carefully and painfully for half an hour, and
      avoiding the trail by the Ghost River, they made their way out of hearing
      of the camp and then set off at such speed as their path allowed, Jerry in
      the lead and Cameron following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Jerry?&rdquo; inquired Cameron as the little half-breed,
      without halt or hesitation, went slipping through the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kananaskis,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Strike trail near Bow Reever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up for a moment, Jerry. I want to talk to you,&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Mak' speed now. Stop in brush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cameron, following close upon his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning broadened into day, but they made no pause till they had left
      behind them the open timber and gained the cover of the forest where the
      underbrush grew thick. Then Jerry, finding a dry and sheltered spot, threw
      himself down and stretched himself at full length waiting for Cameron's
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired, Jerry?&rdquo; said Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non,&rdquo; replied the little man scornfully. &ldquo;When lie down tak' 'em easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now listen! Copperhead is on his way to meet the Blackfeet, but I
      fancy he is going to be disappointed.&rdquo; Then Cameron narrated to Jerry the
      story of his recent interview with Crowfoot. &ldquo;So I don't think,&rdquo; he
      concluded, &ldquo;any Blackfeet will come. Copperhead and Running Stream are
      going to be sold this time. Besides that the Police are on their way to
      Kananaskis following our trail. They will reach Kananaskis to-night and
      start for Ghost River to-morrow. We ought to get Copperhead between us
      somewhere on the Ghost River trail and we must get him to-day. Where will
      he be now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry considered the matter, then, pointing straight eastward, he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On trail Kananaskis not far from Ghost Reever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he be that far?&rdquo; inquired Cameron. &ldquo;He would have to sleep and eat,
      Jerry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non! No sleep&mdash;hit sam' tam' he run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is quite possible,&rdquo; said Cameron, &ldquo;that we may head him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe&mdash;dunno how fas' he go,&rdquo; said Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Jerry, when do we eat?&rdquo; inquired Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull belt tight,&rdquo; said Jerry with a grin. &ldquo;Hit at cache on trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you had the good sense to cache some grub, Jerry, on
      your way down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry lak' squirrel,&rdquo; replied the half-breed. &ldquo;Cache grub many place&mdash;sometam
      come good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great head, Jerry. Now, where is the cache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halfway Kananaskis to Ghost Reever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Jerry, we must make that Ghost River trail and make it quick if we
      are to intercept Copperhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon! We mus' mak' beeg speed for sure.&rdquo; And &ldquo;make big speed&rdquo; they did,
      with the result that by midday they struck the trail not far from Jerry's
      cache. As they approached the trail they proceeded with extreme caution,
      for they knew that at any moment they might run upon Copperhead and his
      band or upon some of their Indian pursuers who would assuredly be
      following them hard. A careful scrutiny of the trail showed that neither
      Copperhead nor their pursuers had yet passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now ver' soon,&rdquo; said Jerry, as he left the trail, and, plunging into
      the brush, led the way with unerring precision to where he had made his
      cache. Quickly they secured the food and with it made their way back to a
      position from which they could command a view of the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go sleep now,&rdquo; said Jerry, after they had done. &ldquo;Me watch one hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gladly Cameron availed himself of the opportunity to catch up his sleep,
      in which he was many hours behind. He stretched himself on the ground and
      in a moment's time lay as completely unconscious as if dead. But before
      half of his allotted time was gone he was awakened by Jerry's hand
      pressing steadily upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian come,&rdquo; whispered the half-breed. Instantly Cameron was wide-awake
      and fully alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many, Jerry?&rdquo; he asked, lying with his ear to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno. T'ree&mdash;four mebbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had not long to wait. Almost as Jerry was speaking the figure of an
      Indian came into view, running with that tireless trot that can wear out
      any wild animal that roams the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperhead!&rdquo; whispered Cameron, tightening his belt and making as if to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; replied Jerry. &ldquo;One more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following Copperhead, and running not close upon him but at some distance
      behind, came another Indian, then another, till three had passed their
      hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four against two, Jerry,&rdquo; said Cameron. &ldquo;That is all right. They have
      their knives, I see, but only one gun. We have no guns and only one knife.
      But Jerry, we can go in and kill them with our bare hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry nodded carelessly. He had fought too often against much greater odds
      in Police battles to be unduly disturbed at the present odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently and at a safe distance behind they fell into the wake of the
      running Indians, Jerry with his moccasined feet leading the way. Mile
      after mile they followed the trail, ever on the alert for the doubling
      back of those whom they were pursuing. Suddenly Cameron heard a sharp hiss
      from Jerry in front. Swiftly he flung himself into the brush and lay
      still. Within a minute he saw coming back upon the trail an Indian, silent
      as a shadow and listening at every step. The Indian passed his
      hiding-place and for some minutes Cameron lay watching until he saw him
      return in the same stealthy manner. After some minutes had elapsed a soft
      hiss from Jerry brought Cameron cautiously out upon the trail once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; whispered Jerry. &ldquo;All Indians pass on before.&rdquo; And once more
      they went forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second time during the afternoon Jerry's warning hiss sent Cameron into
      the brush to allow an Indian to scout his back trail. It was clear that
      the presence of Cameron and the half-breed upon the Ghost River trail had
      awakened the suspicion in Copperhead's mind that the plan to hold a powwow
      at Manitou Rock was known to the Police and that they were on his trail.
      It became therefore increasingly evident to Cameron that any plan that
      involved the possibility of taking Copperhead unawares would have to be
      abandoned. He called Jerry back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if that Indian doubles back on his track again I mean
      to get him. If we get him the other chaps will follow. If I only had a
      gun! But this knife is no use to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give heem to me,&rdquo; said Jerry eagerly. &ldquo;I find heem good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was toward the close of the afternoon when again Jerry's hiss warned
      Cameron that the Indian was returning upon his trail. Cameron stepped into
      the brush at the side, and, crouching low, prepared for the encounter, but
      as he was about to spring Jerry flashed past him, and, hurling himself
      upon the Indian's back, gripped him by the throat and bore him choking to
      earth, knocking the wind out of him and rendering him powerless. Jerry's
      knife descended once bright, once red, and the Indian with a horrible
      gasping cry lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Cameron, seizing the dead man by the shoulders. &ldquo;Lift him
      up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry sprang to seize the legs, and, taking care not to break down the
      brush on either side of the trail, they lifted the body into the thick
      underwood and concealing themselves beside it awaited events. Hardly were
      they out of sight when they heard the soft pad of several feet running
      down the trail. Opposite them the feet stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the Indian runner, and darted back by the way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heem see blood,&rdquo; whispered Jerry. &ldquo;Go back tell Copperhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With every nerve strung to its highest tension they waited, crouching,
      Jerry tingling and quivering with the intensity of his excitement, Cameron
      quiet, cool, as if assured of the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to get that devil this time, Jerry,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;He dragged
      me by the neck once. I will show him something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry laid his hand upon his arm. At a little distance from them there was
      a sound of creeping steps. A few moments they waited and at their side the
      brush began to quiver. A moment later beside Cameron's face a hand
      carrying a rifle parted the screen of spruce boughs. Quick as a flash
      Cameron seized the wrist, gripping it with both hands, and, putting his
      weight into the swing, flung himself backwards; at the same time catching
      the body with his knee, he heaved it clear over their heads and landed it
      hard against a tree. The rifle tumbled from the Indian's hand and he lay
      squirming on the ground. Immediately as Jerry sprang for the rifle a
      second Indian thrust his face through the screen, caught sight of Jerry
      with the rifle, darted back and disappeared with Jerry hard upon his
      trail. Scarcely had they vanished into the brush when Cameron, hearing a
      slight sound at his back, turned swiftly to see a tall Indian charging
      upon him with knife raised to strike. He had barely time to thrust up his
      arm and divert the blow from his neck to his shoulder when the Indian was
      upon him like a wild cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Copperhead!&rdquo; cried Cameron with exultation, as he flung him off. &ldquo;At
      last I have you! Your time has come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sioux paused in his attack, looking scornfully at his antagonist. He
      was dressed in a highly embroidered tight-fitting deerskin coat and
      leggings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted in a voice of quiet, concentrated fury. &ldquo;The white dog
      will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Copperhead,&rdquo; replied Cameron quietly. &ldquo;You have a knife, I have none,
      but I shall lead you like a dog into the Police guard-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sioux said nothing in reply, but kept circling lightly on his toes
      waiting his chance to spring. As the two men stood facing each other there
      was little to choose between them in physical strength and agility as well
      as in intelligent fighting qualities. There was this difference, however,
      that the Indian's fighting had ever been to kill, the white man's simply
      to win. But this difference to-day had ceased to exist. There was in
      Cameron's mind the determination to kill if need be. One immense advantage
      the Indian held in that he possessed a weapon in the use of which he was a
      master and by means of which he had already inflicted a serious wound upon
      his enemy, a wound which as yet was but slightly felt. To deprive the
      Indian of that knife was Cameron's first aim. That once achieved, the end
      could not long be delayed; for the Indian, though a skillful wrestler,
      knows little of the art of fighting with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cameron stood on guard watching his enemy's movements, his mind
      recalled in swift review the various wrongs he had suffered at his hands,
      the fright and insult to his wife, the devastation of his home, the
      cattle-raid involving the death of Raven, and lastly he remembered with a
      deep rage his recent humiliation at the Indian's hands and how he had been
      hauled along by the neck and led like a dog into the Indian camp. At these
      recollections he became conscious of a burning desire to humiliate the
      redskin who had dared to do these things to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind he waited the Indian's attack. The attack came swift as
      a serpent's dart, a feint to strike, a swift recoil, then like a flash of
      light a hard drive with the knife. But quick as was the Indian's drive
      Cameron was quicker. Catching the knife-hand at the wrist he drew it
      sharply down, meeting at the same time the Indian's chin with a short,
      hard uppercut that jarred his head so seriously that his grip on the knife
      relaxed and it fell from his hand. Cameron kicked it behind him into the
      brush while the Indian, with a mighty wrench, released himself from
      Cameron's grip and sprang back free. For some time the Indian kept away
      out of Cameron's reach as if uncertain of himself. Cameron taunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onawata has had enough! He cannot fight unless he has a knife! See! I
      will punish the great Sioux Chief like a little child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Cameron stepped quickly toward him, made a few passes and once,
      twice, with his open hand slapped the Indian's face hard. In a mad fury of
      passion the Indian rushed upon him. Cameron met him with blows, one, two,
      three, the last one heavy enough to lay him on the ground insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, get up!&rdquo; said Cameron contemptuously, kicking him as he might a dog.
      &ldquo;Get up and be a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the Indian rose, wiping his bleeding lips, hate burning in his
      eyes, but in them also a new look, one of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Onawata is a great fighter!&rdquo; smiled Cameron, enjoying to the full the
      humiliation of his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the Indian gathered himself together. He was no coward and he was
      by no means beaten as yet, but this kind of fighting was new to him. He
      apparently determined to avoid those hammering fists of the white man.
      With extraordinary agility he kept out of Cameron's reach, circling about
      him and dodging in and out among the trees. While thus pressing hard upon
      the Sioux Cameron suddenly became conscious of a sensation of weakness.
      The bloodletting of the knife wound was beginning to tell. Cameron began
      to dread that if ever this Indian made up his mind to run away he might
      yet escape. He began to regret his trifling with him and he resolved to
      end the fight as soon as possible with a knock-out blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick eye of the Indian perceived that Cameron's breath was coming
      quicker, and, still keeping carefully out of his enemy's reach, he danced
      about more swiftly than ever. Cameron realized that he must bring the
      matter quickly to an end. Feigning a weakness greater than he felt, he
      induced the Indian to run in upon him, but this time the Indian avoided
      the smashing blow with which Cameron met him, and, locking his arms about
      his antagonist and gripping him by the wounded shoulder, began steadily to
      wear him to the ground. Sickened by the intensity of the pain in his
      wounded shoulder, Cameron felt his strength rapidly leaving him. Gradually
      the Indian shifted his hand up from the shoulder to the neck, the fingers
      working their way toward Cameron's face. Well did Cameron know the savage
      trick which the Indian had in mind. In a few minutes more those fingers
      would be in Cameron's eyes pressing the eyeballs from their sockets. It
      was now the Indian's turn to jibe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;White man no good. Soon he see no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The taunt served to stimulate every ounce of Cameron's remaining strength.
      With a mighty effort he wrenched the Indian's hand from his face, and,
      tearing himself free, swung his clenched fist with all his weight upon the
      Indian's neck. The blow struck just beneath the jugular vein. The Indian's
      grip relaxed, he staggered back a pace, half stunned. Summoning all his
      force, Cameron followed up with one straight blow upon the chin. He needed
      no other. As if stricken by an axe the Indian fell to the earth and lay as
      if dead. Sinking on the ground beside him Cameron exerted all his
      will-power to keep himself from fainting. After a few minutes' fierce
      struggle with himself he was sufficiently revived to be able to bind the
      Indian's hands behind his back with his belt. Searching among the
      brushwood, he found the Indian's knife, and cut from his leather trousers
      sufficient thongs to bind his legs, working with fierce and concentrated
      energy while his strength lasted. At length as the hands were drawn tight
      darkness fell upon his eyes and he sank down unconscious beside his foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that's better! He has lost a lot of blood, but we have checked
      that flow and he will soon be right. Hello, old man! Just waking up, are
      you? Lie perfectly still. Come, you must lie still. What? Oh, Copperhead?
      Well, he is safe enough. What? No, never fear. We know the old snake and
      we have tied him fast. Jerry has a fine assortment of knots adorning his
      person. Now, no more talking for half a day. Your wound is clean enough. A
      mighty close shave it was, but by to-morrow you will be fairly fit.
      Copperhead? Oh, never mind Copperhead. I assure you he is safe enough.
      Hardly fit to travel yet. What happened to him? Looks as if a tree had
      fallen upon him.&rdquo; To which chatter of Dr. Martin's Cameron could only make
      feeble answer, &ldquo;For God's sake don't let him go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the capture of Copperhead the camp at Manitou Lake faded away, for
      when the Police Patrol under Jerry's guidance rode up the Ghost River
      Trail they found only the cold ashes of camp-fires and the debris that
      remains after a powwow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Cameron rode back into Fort Calgary, sore but content,
      for at his stirrup and bound to his saddle-horn rode the Sioux Chief,
      proud, untamed, but a prisoner. As he rode into the little town his quick
      eyes flashed scorn upon all the curious gazers, but in their depths
      beneath the scorn there looked forth an agony that only Cameron saw and
      understood. He had played for a great stake and had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the patrol rode into Fort Calgary the little town was in an uproar of
      jubilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the row?&rdquo; inquired the doctor, for Cameron felt too weary to
      inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great victory for the troops!&rdquo; said a young chap dressed in cow-boy
      garb. &ldquo;Middleton has smashed the half-breeds at Batoche. Riel is captured.
      The whole rebellion business is bust up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cameron threw a swift glance at the Sioux's face. A fierce anxiety looked
      out of the gleaming eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, Jerry,&rdquo; said Cameron to the half-breed who rode at his other
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jerry told the Indian of the total collapse of the rebellion and the
      capture of its leader the stern face grew eloquent with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said, spitting on the ground. &ldquo;Riel he much fool&mdash;no good
      fight. Indian got no Chief&mdash;no Chief.&rdquo; The look on his face all too
      clearly revealed that his soul was experiencing the bitterness of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron almost pitied him, but he spoke no word. There was nothing that
      one could say and besides he was far too weary for anything but rest. At
      the gate of the Barrack yard his old Superintendent from Fort Macleod met
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wounded, Cameron?&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent, glancing in
      alarm at Cameron's wan face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got him,&rdquo; replied Cameron, loosing the lariat from the horn of his
      saddle and handing the end to an orderly. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it seems
      hardly worth while now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth while! Worth while!&rdquo; exclaimed the Superintendent with as much
      excitement as he ever allowed to appear in his tone. &ldquo;Let me tell you,
      Cameron, that if any one thing has kept me from getting into a blue funk
      during these months it was the feeling that you were on patrol along the
      Sun Dance Trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funk?&rdquo; exclaimed Cameron with a smile. &ldquo;Funk?&rdquo; But while he smiled he
      looked into the cold, gray eyes of his Chief, and, noting the unwonted
      glow in them, he felt that after all his work as the Patrol of the Sun
      Dance Trail was perhaps worth while.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHY THE DOCTOR STAYED
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Big Horn River, fed by July suns burning upon glaciers high up between
      the mountain-peaks, was running full to its lips and gleaming like a broad
      ribbon of silver, where, after rushing hurriedly out of the rock-ribbed
      foothills, it settled down into a deep steady flow through the wide valley
      of its own name. On the tawny undulating hillsides, glorious in the
      splendid July sun, herds of cattle and horses were feeding, making with
      the tawny hillsides and the silver river a picture of luxurious ease and
      quiet security that fitted well with the mood of the two men sitting upon
      the shady side of the Big Horn Ranch House.

      Inspector Dickson was enjoying to the full his after-dinner pipe, and with
      him Dr. Martin, who was engaged in judiciously pumping the Inspector in
      regard to the happenings of the recent campaign&mdash;successfully, too,
      except where he touched those events in which the Inspector himself had
      played a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war was over. Batoche had practically settled the Rebellion. Riel was
      in his cell at Regina awaiting trial and execution. Pound-maker, Little
      Pine, Big Bear and some of their other Chiefs were similarly disposed of.
      Copperhead at Macleod was fretting his life out like an eagle in a cage.
      The various regiments of citizen soldiers had gone back to their homes to
      be received with vociferous welcome, except such of them as were received
      in reverent silence, to be laid away among the immortals with quiet
      falling tears. The Police were busily engaged in wiping up the debris of
      the Rebellion. The Commissioner, intent upon his duty, was riding the
      marches, bearing in grim silence the criticism of empty-headed and
      omniscient scribblers, because, forsooth, he had obeyed his Chief's
      orders, and, resisting the greatest provocation to do otherwise, had held
      steadfastly to his post, guarding with resolute courage what was committed
      to his trust. The Superintendents and Inspectors were back at their
      various posts, settling upon the reserves wandering bands of Indians, some
      of whom were just awakening to the fact that they had missed a great
      opportunity and were grudgingly surrendering to the inevitable, and, under
      the wise, firm, judicious handling of the Police, were slowly returning to
      their pre-rebellion status.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Western ranches were rejoicing in a sense of vast relief from the
      terrible pall that like a death-cloud had been hanging over them for six
      months and all Western Canada was thrilling with the expectation of a new
      era of prosperity consequent upon its being discovered by the big world
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the two men thus discussing, Mrs. Cameron, carrying in her arms her
      babe, bore down in magnificent and modest pride, wearing with matronly
      grace her new glory of a great achievement, the greatest open to
      womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just waked up from a very fine sleep,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;to make
      your acquaintance, Inspector. I hope you duly appreciate the honor done
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector rose to his feet and saluted the new arrival with becoming
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cameron, settling herself down with an air of determined
      resolve, &ldquo;I want to hear all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; said the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning, to begin with, that famous march of yours from Calgary to the
      far North land where you did so many heroic things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Inspector's talk had a trick of fading away at the end of the
      third sentence and it was with difficulty that they could get him started
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are most provoking!&rdquo; finally exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, giving up the
      struggle. &ldquo;Isn't he, baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter turned upon the Inspector two steady blue eyes beaming with the
      intelligence of a two months' experience of men and things, and announced
      his grave disapproval of the Inspector's conduct in a distinct &ldquo;goo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother triumphantly. &ldquo;I told you so. What have you
      now to say for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector regarded the blue-eyed atom with reverent wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most remarkable young person I ever saw in my life, Mrs. Cameron,&rdquo; he
      asserted positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud mother beamed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, baby, he IS provoking, but we will forgive him since he is so
      clever at discovering your remarkable qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Dr. Martin. &ldquo;That's nothing. Any one could see them. They
      stick right out of that baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR Dr. Martin,&rdquo; explained the mother with affectionate emphasis, &ldquo;what
      a way you have of putting things. But I wonder what keeps Allan?&rdquo;
       continued Mrs. Cameron. &ldquo;He promised faithfully to be home before dinner.&rdquo;
       She rose, and, going to the side of the house, looked long and anxiously
      up toward the foothills. Dr. Martin followed her and stood at her side
      gazing in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a glorious view it is!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never tire of looking over the
      hills and up to the great mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is the fellow doing?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, disgust and
      rage mingling in his tone. &ldquo;Great Heavens! She is kissing him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? What?&rdquo; exclaimed Mandy. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes following the
      doctor's and lighting upon two figures that stood at the side of the
      poplar bluff in an attitude sufficiently compromising to justify the
      doctor's exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? It's Moira&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;it's Smith! What does it
      mean?&rdquo; The doctor's language appeared unequal to his emotions. &ldquo;Mean?&rdquo; he
      cried, after an exhausting interlude of expletives. &ldquo;Mean? Oh, I don't
      know&mdash;and I don't care. It's pretty plain what it means. It makes no
      difference to me. I gave her up to that other fellow who saved her life
      and then picturesquely got himself killed. There now, forgive me, Mrs.
      Cameron. I know I am a brute. I should not have said that. Don't look at
      me so. Raven was a fine chap and I don't mind her losing her heart to him&mdash;but
      really this is too much. Smith! Of all men under heaven&mdash;Smith! Why,
      look at his legs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His legs? Dr. Martin, I am ashamed of you. I don't care what kind of legs
      he has. Smith is an honorable fellow and&mdash;and&mdash;so good he was to
      us. Why, when Allan and the rest of you were all away he was like a
      brother through all those terrible days. I can never forget his splendid
      kindness&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Cameron, I beg your pardon. Undoubtedly he is a
      fine fellow. I am an ass, a jealous ass&mdash;might as well own it. But,
      really, I cannot quite stand seeing her throw herself at Smith&mdash;Smith!
      Oh, I know, I know, he is all right. But oh&mdash;well&mdash;at any rate
      thank God I saw him at it. It will keep me from openly and uselessly
      abasing myself to her and making a fool of myself generally. But Smith!
      Great God! Smith! Well, it will help to cure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cameron stood by in miserable silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Martin,&rdquo; at length she groaned tearfully, &ldquo;I am so disappointed.
      I was so hoping, and I was sure it was all right&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
      what does it mean? Dear Dr. Martin, I cannot tell you how I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it, Mrs. Cameron, don't pity me. I'll get over it. A little
      surgical operation in the region of the pericardium is all, that is
      required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, vaguely listening to
      him and busy with her own thoughts the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking about, madam? Talking about? I am talking about that organ, the
      central organ of the vascular system of animals, a hollow muscular
      structure that propels the blood by alternate contractions and
      dilatations, which in the mammalian embryo first appears as two tubes
      lying under the head and immediately behind the first visceral arches, but
      gradually moves back and becomes lodged in the thorax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do stop! What nonsense are you talking now?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Cameron,
      waking up as from a dream. &ldquo;No, don't go. You must not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, and I am going to leave this country,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I am
      going East. No, this is no sudden resolve. I have thought of it for some
      time, and now I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must wait at least till Allan returns. You must say good-by to
      him.&rdquo; She followed the doctor anxiously back to his seat beside the
      Inspector. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;hold baby a minute. There are some things I
      must attend to. I would give him to the Inspector, but he would not know
      how to handle him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; ejaculated the Inspector firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you I must get home,&rdquo; said the doctor in helpless wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Cameron. &ldquo;Look out! You are not holding him
      properly. There now, you have made him cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinched him!&rdquo; muttered the Inspector. &ldquo;I call that most unfair. Mean
      advantage to take of the young person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor glowered at the Inspector and set himself with ready skill to
      remedy the wrong he had wrought in the young person's disposition while
      the mother, busying herself ostentatiously with her domestic duties,
      finally disappeared around the house, making for the bluff. As soon as she
      was out of earshot she raised her voice in song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must give the fools warning, I suppose,&rdquo; she said to herself. In the
      pauses of her singing, &ldquo;Oh, what does she mean? I could just shake her. I
      am so disappointed. Smith! Smith! Well, Smith is all right, but&mdash;oh,
      I must talk to her. And yet, I am so angry&mdash;yes, I am disgusted. I
      was so sure that everything was all right. Ah, there she is at last, and&mdash;well&mdash;thank
      goodness he is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h-h-O, Moira!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Now, I must keep my temper,&rdquo; she added to
      herself. &ldquo;But I am so cross about this. Oh-h-h-h-O, Moira!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h-h-O!&rdquo; called Moira in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks positively happy. Ugh! Disgusting! And so lovely too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want me, Mandy? I am so sorry I forgot all about the tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should suppose,&rdquo; snapped Mandy crossly. &ldquo;I saw you were too deeply
      engaged to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, a startled dismay in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I would suggest that you select a less conspicuous stage for
      your next scene. Certainly I got quite a shock. If it had been Raven,
      Moira, I could have stood it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raven! Raven! Oh, stop! Not a word, Mandy.&rdquo; Her voice was hushed and
      there was a look of pain in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Smith!&rdquo; went on Mandy relentlessly. &ldquo;I was too disgusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is wrong with Mr. Smith?&rdquo; inquired Moira, her chin rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is nothing wrong with Smith,&rdquo; replied her sister-in-law
      crossly, &ldquo;but&mdash;well&mdash;kissing him, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kissing him?&rdquo; echoed Moira faintly. &ldquo;Kissing him? I did not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looked to me uncommonly like it at any rate,&rdquo; said Mandy. &ldquo;You surely
      don't deny that you were kissing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not. I mean, it was Smith&mdash;perhaps&mdash;yes, I think Smith
      did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a silly thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly! If I want to kiss Mr. Smith, why is it anybody's business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it,&rdquo; said Mandy indignantly. &ldquo;Why should you want to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is my affair,&rdquo; said Moira in an angry tone, and with a high
      head and lofty air she appeared in the doctor's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. Martin was apparently oblivious of both her lofty air and the
      angle of her chin. He was struggling to suppress from observation a tumult
      of mingled passions of jealousy, rage and humiliation. That this girl whom
      for four years he had loved with the full strength of his intense nature
      should have given herself to another was grief enough; but the fact that
      this other should have been a man of Smith's caliber seemed to add insult
      to his grief. He felt that not only had she humiliated him but herself as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is the kind of girl that enjoys kissing Smith I don't want her,&rdquo;
       he said to himself savagely, and then cursed himself that he knew it was a
      lie. For no matter how she should affront him or humiliate herself he well
      knew he should take her gladly on his bended knees from Smith's hands. The
      cure somehow was not working, but he would allow no one to suspect it. His
      voice was even and his manner cheerful as ever. Only Mrs. Cameron, who
      held the key to his heart, suspected the agony through which he was
      passing during the tea-hour. And it was to secure respite for him that the
      tea was hurried and the doctor packed off to saddle Pepper and round up
      the cows for the milking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepper was by birth and breeding a cow-horse, and once set upon a trail
      after a bunch of cows he could be trusted to round them up with little or
      no aid from his rider. Hence once astride Pepper and Pepper with his nose
      pointed toward the ranging cows, the doctor could allow his heart to roam
      at will. And like a homing pigeon, his heart, after some faint struggles
      in the grip of its owner's will, made swift flight toward the far-away
      Highland glen across the sea, the Cuagh Oir.
    </p>
    <p>
      With deliberate purpose he set himself to live again the tender and
      ineffaceable memories of that eventful visit to the glen when first his
      eyes were filled with the vision of the girl with the sunny hair and the
      sunny eyes who that day seemed to fill the very glen and ever since that
      day his heart with glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      With deliberate purpose, too, he set himself to recall the glen itself,
      its lights and shadows, its purple hilltops, its emerald loch far down at
      the bottom, the little clachan on the hillside and up above it the old
      manor-house. But ever and again his heart would pause to catch anew some
      flitting glance of the brown eyes, some turn of the golden head, some
      cadence of the soft Highland voice, some fitful illusive sweetness of the
      smile upon the curving lips, pause and return upon its tracks to feel anew
      that subtle rapture of the first poignant thrill, lingering over each
      separate memory as a drunkard lingers regretful over his last sweet drops
      of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Pepper's intelligent diligence had sent every cow home to its
      milking, and so, making his way by a short cut that led along the Big Horn
      River and round the poplar bluff, the doctor, suddenly waking from his
      dream of the past, faced with a fresh and sharper stab the reality of the
      present. The suddenness and sharpness of the pain made him pull his horse
      up short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll cut this country and go East,&rdquo; he said aloud, coming to a conclusive
      decision upon a plan long considered, &ldquo;I'll go in for specializing. I have
      done with all this nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat his horse looking eastward over the hills that rolled far away to
      the horizon. His eye wandered down the river gleaming now like gold in the
      sunset glow. He had learned to love this land of great sunlit spaces and
      fresh blowing winds, but this evening its very beauty appeared intolerable
      to him. Ever since the death of Raven upon that tragic night of the
      cattle-raid he had been fighting his bitter loss and disappointment; with
      indifferent success, it is true, but still not without the hope of
      attaining final peace of soul. This evening he knew that, while he lived
      in this land, peace would never come to him, for his heart-wound never
      would heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I will say good-by to-night. By Jove! I feel
      better already. Come along, Pepper! Wake up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pepper woke up to some purpose and at a smart canter carried the doctor on
      his way round the bluff toward a gate that opened into a lane leading to
      the stables. At the gate a figure started up suddenly from the shadow of a
      poplar. With a snort and in the midst of his stride Pepper swung on his
      heels with such amazing abruptness that his rider was flung from his
      saddle, fortunately upon his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you for a dumb-headed fool! What are you up to anyway?&rdquo; he cried
      in a sudden rage, recognizing Smith, who stood beside the trail in an
      abjectly apologetic attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried another voice from the shadow. &ldquo;Is he not a fool? You would
      think he ought to know Mr. Smith by this time. But Pepper is really very
      stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stood speechless, surprise, disgust and rage struggling for
      supremacy among his emotions. He stood gazing stupidly from one to the
      other, utterly at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; began Moira somewhat lamely, &ldquo;had something to say
      to me and so we&mdash;and so we came&mdash;along to the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; replied the doctor gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see Mr. Smith has come to mean a great deal to me&mdash;to us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should imagine,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His self-sacrifice and courage during those terrible days we can never
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so&mdash;quite right,&rdquo; replied the doctor, standing stiffly
      beside his horse's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know people all at once,&rdquo; continued Moira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Not all at once,&rdquo; the doctor replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in times of danger and trouble one gets to know them quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it takes times of danger to bring out the hero in a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should imagine so,&rdquo; replied the doctor with his eyes on Smith's
      childlike and beaming face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see Mr. Smith was really our whole stay, and&mdash;and&mdash;we
      came to rely upon him and we found him so steadfast.&rdquo; In the face of the
      doctor's stolid brevity Moira was finding conversation difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steadfast!&rdquo; repeated the doctor. &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; his eyes upon Smith's
      wobbly legs. &ldquo;Mr. Smith I consider a very fortunate man. I congratulate
      him on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have you heard? I did not know that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I mean&mdash;not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you? Is it not splendid?&rdquo; enthusiasm shining in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! Yes&mdash;that is, for him,&rdquo; replied the doctor without
      emotion. &ldquo;I congratulate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not exactly hear, but I had no difficulty in&mdash;ah&mdash;making
      the discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, discovery. It was fairly plain; I might say it was the feature of
      the view; in fact it stuck right out of the landscape&mdash;hit you in the
      eye, so to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The landscape? What can you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean? Simply that I am at a loss as to whether Mr. Smith is to be
      congratulated more upon his exquisite taste or upon his extraordinary good
      fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fortune, yes, is it not splendid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid is the exact word,&rdquo; said the doctor stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you certainly look happy,&rdquo; replied the doctor with a grim attempt at
      a smile, and feeling as if more enthusiasm were demanded from him. &ldquo;Let me
      offer you my congratulations and say good-by. I am leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be back soon, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. I am leaving the West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving the West? Why? What? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night. Now. I must say good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night? Now?&rdquo; Her voice sank almost to a whisper. Her lips were white
      and quivering. &ldquo;But do they know at the house? Surely this is sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not so sudden. I have thought of it for some time; indeed, I have
      made my plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;for some time? You have made your plans? But you never hinted
      such a thing to&mdash;to any of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I don't tell my plans to all the world,&rdquo; said the doctor with a
      careless laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shrank from him as if he had cut her with his riding whip. But,
      swiftly recovering herself, she cried with gay reproach:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Smith, we are losing all our friends at once. It is cruel of you
      and Dr. Martin to desert us at the same time. Mr. Smith, you know,&rdquo; she
      continued, turning to the doctor with an air of exaggerated vivacity,
      &ldquo;leaves for the East to-night too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith&mdash;leaving?&rdquo; The doctor gazed stupidly at that person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know he has come into a big fortune and is going to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he is going East to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going EAST to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going EAST?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. &ldquo;I don't understand. I thought you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, his young lady is awaiting him in the East. And he is going to
      spend his money in such a splendid way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going EAST?&rdquo; echoed the doctor, as if he could not fix the idea with
      sufficient firmness in his brain to grasp it fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have just told you so,&rdquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo; shouted the doctor, suddenly rushing at Smith and gripping him
      by both arms. &ldquo;Smith, you shy dog&mdash;you lucky dog! Let me wish you
      joy, old man. By Jove! You deserve your luck, every bit of it. Say, that's
      fine. Ha! ha! Jeerupiter! Smith, you are a good one and a sly one. Shake
      again, old man. Say, by Jove! What a sell&mdash;I mean what a joke! Look
      here, Smith, old chap, would you mind taking Pepper home? I am rather
      tired&mdash;riding, I mean&mdash;beastly wild cows&mdash;no end of a run
      after them. See you down at the house later. No, no, don't wait, don't
      mind me. I am all right, fit as a fiddle&mdash;no, not a bit tired&mdash;I
      mean I am tired riding. Yes, rather stiff&mdash;about the knees, you know.
      Oh, it's all right. Up you get, old man&mdash;there you are! So, Smith,
      you are going to be married, eh? Lucky dog! Tell 'em I am&mdash;tell 'em
      we are coming. My horse? Oh, well, never mind my horse till I come myself.
      So long, old chap! Ha! ha! old man, good-by. Great Caesar! What a sell!
      Say, let's sit down, Moira,&rdquo; he said, suddenly growing quiet and turning
      to the girl, &ldquo;till I get my wind. Fine chap that Smith. Legs a bit wobbly,
      but don't care if he had a hundred of 'em and all wobbly. He's all right.
      Oh, my soul! What an ass! What an adjectival, hyphenated jackass! Don't
      look at me that way or I shall climb a tree and yell. I'm not mad, I
      assure you. I was on the verge of it a few moments ago, but it is gone. I
      am sane, sane as an old maid. Oh, my God!&rdquo; He covered his face with his
      hands and sat utterly still for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Martin, what is the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;You terrify me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder. I terrify myself. How could I have stood it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Moira, I thought you were going to marry that idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, drawing herself up. &ldquo;Idiot? Mr. Smith? I am
      not going to marry him, Dr. Martin, but he is an honorable fellow and a
      friend of mine, a dear friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is, so he is, a splendid fellow, the finest ever, but thank God you
      are not going to marry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is wrong with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Why? God help me! Why? Only because, Moira, I love you.&rdquo; He threw
      himself upon his knees beside her. &ldquo;Don't, don't for God's sake get away!
      Give me a chance to speak!&rdquo; He caught her hand in both of his. &ldquo;I have
      just been through hell. Don't send me there again. Let me tell you. Ever
      since that minute when I saw you in the glen I have loved you. In my
      thoughts by day and in my dreams by night you have been, and this day when
      I thought I had lost you I knew that I loved you ten thousand times more
      than ever.&rdquo; He was kissing her hand passionately, while she sat with head
      turned away. &ldquo;Tell me, Moira, if I may love you? And is it any use? And do
      you think you could love me even a little bit? I am not worthy to touch
      you. Tell me.&rdquo; Still she sat silent. He waited a few moments, his face
      growing gray. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said at length in a broken, husky voice. &ldquo;I
      will try to bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face toward him. The sunny eyes were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were going away from me?&rdquo; she breathed, leaning toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart!&rdquo; he cried, putting his arms around her and drawing her to
      him, &ldquo;tell me to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;or take me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had long since disappeared behind the big purple mountains and
      even the warm afterglow in the eastern sky had faded into a pearly
      opalescent gray when the two reached the edge of the bluff nearest the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! The milking!&rdquo; cried Moira aghast, as she came in sight of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Caesar! I was going to help,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said the girl penitently. &ldquo;But, of course, there's Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly there's Smith. What a God-send that chap is. He is always
      on the spot. But Cameron is home. I see his horse. Let us go in and face
      the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found an excited group standing in the kitchen, Mandy with a letter
      in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are at last!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where have you&mdash;&rdquo; She glanced
      at Moira's face and then at the doctor's and stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, what's up?&rdquo; cried the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got a letter&mdash;such a letter!&rdquo; cried Mandy. &ldquo;Read it. Read it
      aloud, Doctor.&rdquo; She thrust the letter into his hand. The doctor cleared
      his throat, struck an attitude, and read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cameron:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to say for the officers of the Police Force in
      the South West district and for myself that we greatly appreciate the
      distinguished services you rendered during the past six months in your
      patrol of the Sun Dance Trail. It was a work of difficulty and danger and
      one of the highest importance to the country. I feel sure it will gratify
      you to know that the attention of the Government has been specially called
      to the creditable manner in which you have performed your duty, and I have
      no doubt that the Government will suitably express its appreciation of
      your services in due time. But, as you are aware, in the Force to which we
      have the honor to belong, we do not look for recognition, preferring to
      find a sufficient reward in duty done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me also to say that we recognize and appreciate the spirit of
      devotion showed by Mrs. Cameron during these trying months in so
      cheerfully and loyally giving you up to this service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I add that in this rebellion to my mind the most critical factor was
      the attitude of the great Blackfeet Confederacy. Every possible effort was
      made by the half-breeds and Northern Indians to seduce Crowfoot and his
      people from their loyalty, and their most able and unscrupulous agent in
      this attempt was the Sioux Indian known among us as The Copperhead. That
      he failed utterly in his schemes and that Crowfoot remained loyal I
      believe is due to the splendid work of the officers and members of our
      Force in the South West district, but especially to your splendid services
      as the Patrol of the Sun Dance Trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And signed by the big Chief himself, the Commissioner,&rdquo; cried Dr. Martin.
      &ldquo;What do you think of that, Baby?&rdquo; he continued, catching the baby from
      its mother's arms. &ldquo;What do you think of your daddy?&rdquo; The doctor
      pirouetted round the room with the baby in his arms, that young person
      regarding the whole performance apparently with grave and profound
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your horse is ready,&rdquo; said Smith, coming in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your horse?&rdquo; cried Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I forgot,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;I don't think I want him
      to-night, Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to-night, then?&rdquo; inquired Mandy in delighted surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;in fact, I believe I have changed my mind about that. I
      have, been&mdash;ah&mdash;persuaded to remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; cried Mandy in supreme delight. Then turning swiftly upon her
      sister-in-law who stood beside the doctor, her face in a radiant glow, she
      added, &ldquo;Then what did you mean by&mdash;by&mdash;what we saw this
      afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deeper red dyed the girl's cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; cried Dr. Martin. &ldquo;Oh, that kissing Smith
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't just help it!&rdquo; burst out Moira. &ldquo;He was so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to be married, you know,&rdquo; interjected the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! that's all right! I'd kiss Smith
      myself. I feel like doing it this blessed minute. Where is he? Smith!
      Where are you?&rdquo; But Smith had escaped. &ldquo;Smith's all right, I say, and so
      are we, eh, Moira?&rdquo; He slipped his arm round the blushing girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad,&rdquo; cried Mandy, beaming upon them. &ldquo;And you are not going
      East after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East? Not I! The West for me. I am going to stay right in it&mdash;with
      the Inspector here&mdash;and with you, Mrs. Cameron&mdash;and with my
      sweetheart&mdash;and yes, certainly with the Patrol of the Sun Dance
      Trail.&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes informationS about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
